# EduSpark

All of your child's learning in **one** place


## Our Story

While brainstorming for our project, we felt inspired to address the misunderstandings that would occur when parents and teachers tried to communicate with each other. Both sides were often too occupied to connect well, leading to a breakdown in sharing vital information about students. This realization sparked our determination to create an elegant solution - EduSpark.

EduSpark acts as a "bridge", aiding clear and concise communication among busy parents and teachers. The tool enables teachers to instantly share curriculum updates, student progress, upcoming events, and learning resources. Parents, can interact by asking queries or giving feedback. Building EduSpark wasn’t easy: distilling many communication elements into a simple, user-friendly application was quite a task. However, seeing it work, keeping everyone in sync and fostering partnership in the education journey, is an accomplishment we’re proud of. We have learned the power of efficient communication in education and are excited about enhancing EduSpark even further, in our commitment to supporting this important link between teachers and parents.
