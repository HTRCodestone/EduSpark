This document replaces *The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 and 10: English, 1999
------------------------------------------------------*. Beginning in  
September 2007, all English courses for Grades 9 and 10 will be based on the expectations  
outlined in this document.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
----------------------------------------------

The goal of Ontario secondary schools is to support high-quality learning while giving  
individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests.  
The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options  
outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their  
high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY, LANGUAGE, AND THEENGLISH CURRICULUM
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Literacy is about more than reading or writing it is about how we communicate in society. It is about social practices and relationships, about knowledge, language and culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Those who use literacy take it for granted but those who cannot use it are excludedfrom much communication in today s world. Indeed, it is the excluded who can bestappreciate the notion of literacy as freedom .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

UNESCO, Statement for the United Nations Literacy Decade, 2003 2012

Literacy development is a communal project, and the teaching of literacy skills is embedded  
across the Ontario curriculum. However, it is the English curriculum that is dedicated to  
developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based that is, knowledge and  
skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing.

Language development is central to students intellectual, social, cultural, and emotional  
growth and must be seen as a key component of the curriculum. When students learn to  
use language, they do more than master the basic skills. They learn to value the power   
of language and to use it responsibly. They learn to express feelings and opinions and to  
support their opinions with sound arguments and evidence from research. They become  
aware of the many purposes for which language is used and the diverse forms it can take  
to serve particular purposes and audiences. They learn to use the formal language appro-  
priate for debates and essays, the narrative language of stories and novels, the figurative  
language of poetry, the technical language of instructions and manuals. They develop   
an awareness of how language is used in different formal and informal situations. They  
come to understand that language is an important medium for communicating ideas and

INTRODUCTION



  

information, expressing world views, and realizing and communicating artistic vision.  
Students learn that language can be not only used as a tool but also appreciated and enjoyed.

Language is the basis for thinking, communicating, learning, and viewing the world.  
Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact  
socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and  
demonstrate their learning. Learning to communicate with clarity and precision will help  
students to thrive in the world beyond school.

Language is a fundamental element of identity and culture. As students read and reflect  
on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,

1 they develop a deeper under-

standing of themselves and others and of the world around them. If they see themselves  
and others in the texts they study, they will be more engaged in learning and they will  
also come to appreciate the nature and value of a diverse, multicultural society. They will  
develop the ability to understand and critically interpret a range of texts and to recognize  
that a text conveys one particular perspective among many.

Language skills are developed across the curriculum and, cumulatively, through the grades.  
Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics,  
themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all  
subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability  
to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students  
develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time.  
As they move through the secondary school program, they are required to use language  
with ever-increasing accuracy and fluency in an expanding range of situations. They are  
also expected to assume responsibility for their own learning and to apply their language  
skills in more challenging and complex ways.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM
--------------------------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible  
and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners.  
The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they  
need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

Successful language learners:

understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;

communicate that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent effectively  
and with confidence;

make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts,  
and the world around them;

think critically;

understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized,  
questioned, assessed, and evaluated;

appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;

use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal  
growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

1. The word *text* is used in this document in its broadest sense, as a means of communication that uses words, graphics,  
sounds, and/or images to convey information and ideas to an audience.



  

The English curriculum takes into account that students in Ontario come from a wide  
variety of backgrounds and that every student has a unique set of perspectives, strengths,  
and needs. Instructional strategies and resources that recognize and reflect the diversity in  
the classroom and that suit individual strengths and needs are therefore critical to student  
success. Reading activities should expose students to materials that reflect the diversity of  
Canadian and world cultures, including those of Aboriginal peoples. Students also need  
to become familiar with the works of recognized writers from their own and earlier eras.  
By reading a wide range of materials and being challenged by what they read, students  
become receptive to new and widely varying ideas and perspectives, and develop their  
ability to think independently and critically.

Research has shown that when students are given opportunities to choose what they   
read and what they write about, they are more likely to discover and pursue their own  
interests. In keeping with this finding, the curriculum requires that students select some  
of the texts they read and decide on the topic, purpose, and audience for some of the  
works they produce.

Research has also shown that effective readers and writers unconsciously apply a range  
of skills and strategies as they read and write. By identifying and explicitly teaching these  
skills and strategies, teachers enable all students to become effective communicators. The  
English curriculum focuses on comprehension strategies for listening, viewing, and reading;  
on the most effective reading and writing processes; on skills and techniques for effective  
oral and written communication and for the creation of effective media texts; and on the  
language conventions needed for clear and coherent communication. In addition, it empha-  
sizes the use of higher-level thinking skills, including critical literacy skills, to enable students  
to understand, appreciate, and evaluate what they read and view at a deeper level, and to  
help them become reflective, critical, and independent learners.

In implementing this curriculum, teachers will help students to see that language skills are  
lifelong learning skills that will enable them to better understand themselves and others,  
unlock their potential as human beings, find fulfilling careers, and become responsible  
world citizens. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENGLISH PROGRAMS Students
-------------------------------------------------------

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make   
the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon  
discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and  
will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will  
find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges  
they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely impor-  
tant to these students success. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and  
learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances.

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with the language curriculum requires work,  
study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue  
opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of the  
communication process. Their understanding and skills will grow as they explore their  
world and engage in activities, for their own purposes, that involve reading, writing,

speaking, listening, viewing, and representing. Students develop their literacy skills when  
they seek out recreational reading materials and multimedia works that relate to their  
personal interests and to other subject areas, and when they engage in conversation with  
parents, peers, and teachers about what they are reading, writing, viewing, representing,  
and thinking in their daily lives.

Parents
-------

Parents

2 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show 

that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education.   
By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in  
the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This  
awareness will enhance parents ability to discuss their children s work with them, to  
communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children s progress.  
Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret  
teachers comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their   
children s learning.

Effective ways in which parents can support their children s learning include attending  
parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops and school council activities  
(including becoming a school council member), and encouraging their children to com-  
plete their assignments at home. 

In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to encourage their  
sons and daughters to take an active interest in using language for meaningful purposes  
as a regular part of their activities outside school. They might encourage them to read  
every day; take out a library membership; join a book club, a computer club, a camera  
club, or a community group; or subscribe to an age-appropriate magazine. They might  
also initiate conversations at home about what their daughters and sons are reading. 

Teachers
--------

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropri-  
ate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well  
as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers bring  
enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing  
different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student.

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide  
numerous opportunities for students to develop the literacy and language skills that will  
allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active  
citizens. The study of literature and the media provides students with an awareness and  
appreciation of the culture that surrounds, challenges, and nourishes them.

Principals
----------

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student  
has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, prin-  
cipals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms  
using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are  
made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects,  
including English, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate  
their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible  
for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving  
the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan in other words,  
for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

The English program in Grades 9 to 12 includes *compulsory courses
------------------*and *optional courses
----------------*.

The compulsory courses emphasize strong core competencies in listening, speaking, reading,  
writing, viewing, and representing. As part of their program in Grades 9 and 10, students  
must take one compulsory course in English in each grade. These courses are offered in  
two types, academic and applied.

3

One optional course is offered in the Grade 9 10 curriculum Literacy Skills: Reading and  
Writing, Grade 10. This course offers students an opportunity to enhance their literacy skills.  
It may be taken to fulfil an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional compul-  
sory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It may also be  
used, at the principal s discretion, as a substitution for one of the compulsory credits required  
in English. The Literacy Skills course is an open course.

Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and  
postsecondary goals. The course types offered in Grades 9 and 10 are defined as follows:

*Academic courses
----------------*

develop students knowledge and skills through the study of theory and

abstract problems. These courses focus on the essential concepts of a subject and explore  
related concepts as well. They incorporate practical applications as appropriate.

*Applied courses
---------------*

focus on the essential concepts of a subject, and develop students knowledge

and skills through practical applications and concrete examples. Familiar situations are  
used to illustrate ideas, and students are given more opportunities to experience hands-on  
applications of the concepts and theories they study.

*Open courses
------------*

are designed to prepare students for further study in the subject, and to

enrich their education generally. These courses comprise a set of expectations that are  
appropriate for all students.

School boards may offer a locally developed compulsory credit (LDCC) course in English  
in each of Grades 9 and 10, which may be used to meet the compulsory credit requirement  
in English for these grades.

4 The Grade 9 and 10 LDCC courses prepare students for suc-

cess in the Grade 11 English workplace preparation course.

THE PROGRAM 

IN ENGLISH

3. If the principal deems that the academic and applied courses in either Grade 9 or Grade 10 are sufficiently different,  
a student may take both courses and, on successful completion, earn a credit for each.   
4. If a student successfully completes both an LDCC course in Grade 9 or Grade 10 English and a curriculum course in English  
in the same grade, the principal may grant a credit for each course, bearing in mind that only one compulsory English credit is  
required in each grade. (The second credit can be used to meet an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional com-  
pulsory credit requirement.)

Half-Credit Courses
-------------------

The courses outlined in the Grade 9 12 English curriculum documents are designed   
as full-credit courses. However*, with the exception of Grade 12 university preparation and university/college preparation courses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses.

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instruction-  
al time, must adhere to the following conditions:

The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the  
expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be  
drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best  
enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time.

A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may  
be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both  
parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete  
both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.)

The title of each half-credit course must include the designation *Part 1
------*or *Part 2
------*. A  
half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card  
and the Ontario Student Transcript.

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described  
above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School  
October Report.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS
-----------------------

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that stu-  
dents are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in vari-  
ous other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand (or broad curriculum area) of every  
course overall expectations and specific expectations. The *overall expectations
--------------------*describe in  
general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the  
end of each course. The *specific expectations
---------------------*describe the expected knowledge and skills in  
greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered headings, or sub-  
organizers , each of which indicates the overall expectation to which the group of specific  
expectations corresponds. Each expectation in a group is identified by an expectation  
tag (a subheading) that describes the particular aspect of the overall expectation to  
which the specific expectation refers (see the illustration on page 13). 

Taken together, the overall and specific expectations represent the mandated curriculum.

In the core English curriculum (the compulsory courses offered in every grade), the *over-all expectations
---------------------*outline standard sets of knowledge and skills required for effective listen-  
ing and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. They encompass the  
types of understanding, skills, approaches, and processes that are applied by effective  
communicators of all ages and levels of development, and are therefore described in con-  
stant terms from grade to grade. The English curriculum focuses on developing the depth

and level of sophistication of students knowledge and skills associated with each of these  
key overall expectations by increasing the complexity of the texts they work with and the  
tasks they perform over time.

The *specific expectations
---------------------*reflect this progression in knowledge and skills from grade to  
grade, and also indicate differences between course types, through a combination of the  
following: (1) the wording of the expectation itself, (2) the examples that are given in  
parentheses in the expectation, and/or (3) the teacher prompts that may follow the expec-  
tation. The examples and teacher prompts help to clarify the requirements specified in the  
expectations and suggest the intended depth and level of complexity of the expectations.  
They have been developed to model appropriate practice for the particular grade and  
course type and are meant to serve as illustrations for teachers. Teachers can choose to  
use the examples and teacher prompts that are appropriate for their classrooms, or they  
may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the  
specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in  
the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the  
student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM*Compulsory Courses*
-----------------------------------------------------

The expectations in the compulsory courses of the English curriculum are organized in  
four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature  
Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. The program in all grades is designed to develop a  
range of essential skills in these four interrelated areas, built on a solid foundation of  
knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical,  
critical, and metacognitive thinking skills. Students learn best when they are encouraged  
to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations  
that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the  
four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to,  
create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in  
the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that  
blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of  
experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy  
skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

Oral Communication
------------------

Oral language is a fundamental means of communication with others and the cornerstone  
of learning in all areas. Through talk, students not only communicate information but  
also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems;  
organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings,  
and opinions. When they converse about information and ideas, they become aware not  
only of the various perspectives of other speakers and writers but also of the language  
structures and conventions they use. As students work towards achieving the expecta-  
tions for this strand, they will improve their ability to explore and communicate ideas in  
both classroom and formal speaking situations.

To develop their oral communication skills, students need numerous opportunities to listen  
and to talk about a range of subjects, including personal interests, cultural knowledge,  
school work, and current affairs. The language program should provide opportunities   
for students to engage in various thought-provoking oral activities in connection with  
expectations in all the strands for example, brainstorming to identify what they know  
about the topic of a new text they are about to read, discussing strategies for solving a  
problem in a writing assignment, presenting and defending ideas or debating issues, and  
offering informal critiques of work produced by their peers. 

Listening and speaking are essential skills for social interaction at home, at school, and   
in the community. In order for all students to benefit from the opportunities provided in the  
classroom for listening and speaking, differences in the norms and conventions associated  
with oral communication in different cultures must be taken into account. In addition,   
for some students, the notion that learning involves talk is unfamiliar, and talk that sup-  
ports learning must be explicitly taught and modelled. All students can benefit from oppor-  
tunities to improve their listening and response skills and to refine their ideas and their  
ability to express them. The Oral Communication strand focuses on the identification and  
development of the skills and strategies effective listeners and speakers use to understand  
and interact with others. It also emphasizes the use of higher-order thinking skills to   
stimulate students interest and engage them in their own learning.

Reading and Literature Studies
------------------------------

Although many students entering the Grade 9 English program are fluent, independent  
readers, some may need additional support to develop their reading skills and to monitor  
their own progress. In addition, all students need instruction to cope with the more chal-  
lenging reading demands of the secondary school curriculum, which requires students to  
consider increasingly abstract concepts and to use language structures that are more com-  
plex and vocabulary that is more specialized than in earlier grades. The English program  
will help students learn to read efficiently and to absorb information quickly. 

The English curriculum focuses on developing the knowledge and skills that will enable  
students to become effective readers. An effective reader is one who not only grasps the  
ideas communicated in a text but is able to apply them in new contexts. To do this, the  
reader must be able to think clearly, creatively, and critically about the ideas and informa-  
tion encountered in texts in order to understand, analyse, and absorb them and to recog-  
nize their relevance in other contexts. Students can develop the skills necessary to become  
effective readers by applying a range of comprehension strategies as they read and by  
reading a wide variety of texts. It is also important that they read a range of materials that  
illustrate the many uses of writing. By reading widely, students will develop a richer  
vocabulary and become more attuned to the conventions of written language. Reading  
various kinds of texts in all areas of the curriculum will also help students to discover  
what interests them most and to pursue and develop their interests and abilities.

Reading is a complex process that involves the application of various strategies before,  
during, and after reading. For example, before reading, students might prepare by identi-  
fying the purpose of the reading activity and by activating their prior knowledge about  
the topic of the text. Teachers help build the necessary background knowledge for stu-  
dents whose life experiences may not have provided them with the information they  
need to understand the text. During reading, students may use cueing systems that is,

THE PROGRAM IN ENGLISH
----------------------



  

clues from context or from their understanding of language structures and/or letter-sound  
relationships to help them solve unfamiliar words, and comprehension strategies to help  
them make meaning of the text. Comprehension strategies include predicting, visualizing,  
questioning, drawing inferences, identifying main ideas, summarizing, and monitoring  
and revising comprehension. After reading, students may analyse, synthesize, make con-  
nections, evaluate, and use other critical and creative thinking skills to achieve a deeper  
understanding of the material they have read. It is important to note that although the  
specific expectations for each grade may focus on particular strategies that emphasize  
grade-appropriate skills, they do not impose a restriction on the range of strategies students  
will apply in that grade. Teachers must use their professional judgement in deciding which  
comprehension strategies to model and teach, based on the identified learning needs of  
the students in their classrooms and on the nature of the particular texts students are reading.

Fluent, independent readers read frequently for a variety of different purposes to locate  
information, to satisfy curiosity, for enjoyment, to build vocabulary, for research, and for  
various more specifically defined purposes. The purpose for reading will be determined  
by the teacher in some cases and by the student in others. The reading program should  
include a wide variety of literary, informational, and graphic texts that engage students   
interest and imagination for example, novels; poetry; myths, fables, and folk tales; short  
stories; textbooks and books on topics in science, history, mathematics, geography, and  
other subjects; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and journals; plays and radio, film,  
or television scripts; encyclopaedia entries; graphs, charts, and diagrams in textbooks or  
magazine articles; instructions and manuals; graphic novels, comic books, and cartoons;  
newspaper articles and editorials; databases and websites; and essays and reports.  
Teachers routinely provide materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world   
cultures, including the cultures of Aboriginal peoples. Within each course and from one  
grade to another, students should be assigned texts of increasing complexity as they  
develop their reading skills, and should also have many opportunities to select their   
own reading materials. Frequent exposure to good writing will inspire students to work  
towards high standards in their own writing and will help them develop an appreciation  
for the power and beauty of the written word.

The study of literature is central in the secondary English curriculum; it offers students  
opportunities to expand their intellectual horizons and to extend and strengthen their lit-  
eracy skills. As a creative representation of life and experience, literature raises important  
questions about the human condition, now and in the past. As students increase their  
knowledge of accomplished writers and literary works, and vicariously experience times,  
events, cultures, and values different from their own, they deepen their understanding of  
the many dimensions of human thought and human experience. 

All students, regardless of their postsecondary plans, need to read a balance of exemplary  
literary, informational, and graphic texts that nourish the imagination, promote intellectu-  
al growth, contribute to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, and provide a broad range of  
language models for their own writing. They should be exposed to literary works drawn  
from many genres, historical periods, and cultures, by both female and male writers, that  
represent a wide range of perspectives and reflect the diversity of Canada and the world.

This strand helps students learn to read with understanding, to read critically, to become  
familiar with various text forms and their characteristic elements, and to recognize the  
function and effects of various text features and stylistic devices. It helps students

understand that reading is a process of constructing meaning and equips them with the  
strategies that good readers use to understand and appreciate what they read.

Writing
-------

*Writing provides students with powerful opportunities to learn about themselves andtheir connections to the world. Through writing, students organize their thoughts, rememberimportant information, solve problems, reflect on a widening range of perspectives, andlearn how to communicate effectively for specific purposes and audiences. They findtheir voice and have opportunities to explore other voices. By putting their thoughtsinto words and supporting the words with visual images in a range of media, studentsacquire knowledge and deepen their understanding of the content in all school subjects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Ministry of Education, *Literacy for Learning, 2004*, p. 79

A central goal of the Writing strand is to promote students growth as confident writers and  
researchers who can communicate competently using a range of forms and styles to suit  
specific purposes and audiences and correctly applying the conventions of language   
grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. These conventions are best learned in the  
context of meaningful and creative writing activities that allow students to develop the  
ability to think and write clearly and effectively.

Writing, from initial musings to final publication, is a complex process that involves a  
range of complementary thinking and composing skills, as well as other language  
processes, including reading, speaking, and listening. As writers compose, they consider  
their audience; make decisions about form, style, and organization; and apply their  
knowledge of language use. To develop these competencies, students need a supportive  
classroom environment, with opportunities to extend and refine their skills in using the  
writing process and doing research. At the secondary level, teachers continue to teach  
and model effective strategies and skills, as well as provide appropriate scaffolding for  
students who are building skills and working towards independence. Students need  
opportunities to apply these skills and to write daily, in many forms and genres, for a  
variety of purposes and audiences, and within different time constraints. The forms and  
genres explored may include essays, reports, short stories, poetry, scripts, journals, letters,  
biographies, children s stories, articles, reviews, pr cis, explanations, instructions, notes,  
procedures, r sum s, and advertisements. Because postsecondary institutions and  
employers require clear, well-organized writing, on demand and within strict timelines,  
students also need to learn and practise strategies for writing effectively and correctly in  
the context of in-class writing assignments and test situations.

Students benefit from opportunities to produce writing that is interesting and original and  
that reflects their capacity for independent critical thought. Writing activities that students  
find meaningful and that challenge them to think creatively about topics and concerns that  
interest them will lead to a fuller and more lasting command of the essential skills of writing. 

The overall expectations in this strand focus on the elements of effective writing  
(ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, language conventions,  
and presentation) and on the stages of the recursive writing process (planning for writing,  
drafting, revising, editing and proofreading, and publishing). In the specific expectations,  
the examples and teacher prompts refer to writing forms and language conventions that  
are appropriate for instruction in the given course. The forms and conventions noted are  
not, however, the only ones that may be taught in the course, nor are they exclusive to the

course. Teachers will continue to make professional decisions about which writing forms  
and language conventions they will cover in every course, based on the identified learning  
needs of the students in their classrooms. 

Media Studies
-------------

Media Studies focuses on the art, meaning, and messaging of various forms of media texts.  
Media texts can be understood to include any work, object, or event that communicates  
meaning to an audience. Most media texts use words, graphics, sounds, and/or images, in  
print, oral, visual, or electronic form, to communicate information and ideas to their audi-  
ence. Whereas traditional English language study may be seen to focus primarily on the  
understanding of the word, media studies focuses on the construction of meaning through  
the combination of several media languages images, sounds, graphics, and words.

Media Studies explores the impact and influence of mass media and popular culture by  
examining texts such as films, songs, video games, action figures, advertisements, CD  
covers, clothing, billboards, television shows, magazines, newspapers, photographs, and  
websites.

5 These texts abound in our electronic information age, and the messages they

convey, both overt and implied, can have a significant influence on students lives. For  
this reason, critical thinking as it applies to media products and messages assumes a   
special significance. Understanding how media texts are constructed and why they are  
produced enables students to respond to them intelligently and responsibly. Students  
must be able to differentiate between fact and opinion; evaluate the credibility of sources;  
recognize bias; be attuned to discriminatory portrayals of individuals and groups, such as  
religious or sexual minorities, people with disabilities, or seniors; and question depictions  
of violence and crime.

Students repertoire of communication skills should include the ability to critically inter-  
pret the messages they receive through the various media and to use these media to com-  
municate their own ideas effectively as well. Skills related to high-tech media such as the  
Internet, film, and television are particularly important because of the power and perva-  
sive influence these media wield in our lives and in society. Becoming conversant with  
these and other media can greatly expand the range of information sources available to  
students, and enhance potential career opportunities in the communication and entertain-  
ment industries.

To develop their media literacy skills, students should have opportunities to view,  
analyse, and discuss a wide variety of media texts and relate them to their own experi-  
ence. They should also have opportunities to use available technologies to create media  
texts of different types (e.g., computer graphics, cartoons, graphic designs and layouts,  
radio plays, short videos, web pages).

5. Teachers should make students aware that images, print materials, music, or video clips used in connection with  
tasks and assignments may be subject to copyright, and the appropriate releases should be obtained prior to use. This  
applies to items downloaded from the Internet as well.



  

This strand focuses on helping students develop the skills required to understand, create,  
and critically interpret media texts. It examines how images (both moving and still),  
sound, and words are used, independently and in combination, to create meaning. It  
explores the use and significance of particular conventions and techniques in the media  
and considers the roles of the viewer and the producer in constructing meaning in media  
texts. Students apply the knowledge and skills gained through analysis of media texts as  
they create their own texts.

In the specific expectations in this strand, the examples and teacher prompts refer to  
media forms and conventions that are appropriate for instruction in the given course.  
These are not, however, the only forms and conventions that students may explore in the  
course, nor are they exclusive to the course. Teachers will continue to use their profes-  
sional judgement to decide on the forms and conventions students will study in every  
course, based on the identified learning needs of the students in their classrooms.

*Optional Courses
----------------*The expectations in the optional courses in the English program are clustered in strands  
suited to the particular theme or focus of the course. 

The Grade 10 optional course, Literacy Skills: Reading and Writing, contains two strands:  
Reading Skills and Writing Skills.

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information  
gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses  
in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also  
serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students   
needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices.

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including  
assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects  
how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of  
assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts  
towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student  
work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and  
the achievement levels outlined in this document.

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they  
lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evalua-  
tion strategies that:

address both what students learn and how well they learn;

are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement  
level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 24 25; 

are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide  
opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 

are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the  
needs and experiences of the students;

are fair to all students; 

accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with  
the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 

accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction  
(English or French);

ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 

promote students ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 

include the use of samples of students work that provide evidence of   
their achievement; 

are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or  
the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses  
on students achievement of the overall expectations. A student s achievement of the  
overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific  
expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations  
define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the over-  
all expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which spe-  
cific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and  
which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observa-  
tion) but not necessarily evaluated.

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 24 25) for level 3 represent the  
 provincial standard for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture  
of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in English can be constructed by reading  
from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed 70 79%  
(Level 3) . Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will  
be prepared for work in subsequent courses.

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still  
reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard.  
Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that  
achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond  
those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or  
almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability  
to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student  
achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR ENGLISH
---------------------------------

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in  
English. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers.  
It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear per-  
formance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to:

provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for   
all courses outlined in this document; 

guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 

help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 

assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students;

provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate   
students learning.

Categories of Knowledge and Skills
----------------------------------

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and  
skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four  
categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and intercon-  
nectedness of learning.

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows:

*Knowledge and Understanding.
----------------------------*

Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowl-

edge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

*Thinking.
---------*

The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:

planning skills (e.g., generating ideas, gathering information, focusing research,  
organizing information)

processing skills (e.g., drawing inferences, interpreting, analysing, synthesizing,  
evaluating)

critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., oral discourse, research, critical analysis,  
critical literacy, metacognition, creative process)

*Communication.
--------------*

The conveying of meaning through various text forms.

*Application.
------------*

The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between

various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced man-  
ner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is  
considered within the appropriate categories.

Criteria
--------

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of  
the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and  
Understanding, the criteria are knowledge of content (e.g., forms of text; strategies used  
when listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing; elements of  
style; literary terminology, concepts, and theories; language conventions) and under-  
standing of content (e.g., concepts; ideas; opinions; relationships among facts, ideas, con-  
cepts, themes) . The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed  
and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for.

Descriptors
-----------

A descriptor indicates the characteristic of the student s performance, with respect to   
a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement  
chart, *effectiveness
-------------*is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication,  
and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task  
will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may  
therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic,  
relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particu-  
lar criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might  
focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication  
category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in  
the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections.  
Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might  
focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an  
explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific  
knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better under-  
stand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated.

Qualifiers
----------

A specific qualifier is used to define each of the four levels of achievement that is,  
*limited
-------*for level 1, *some
----*for level 2, *considerable
------------*for level 3, and a *high degree
-----------*or *thorough
--------*for  
level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of perform-  
ance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student s performance at   
level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: the student  
uses planning skills with *considerable
------------*effectiveness . 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify  
the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, stu-  
dents should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent  
of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowl-  
edge and skills.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means  
of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12. The report card provides a record of the stu-  
dent s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in  
the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade rep-  
resents the quality of the student s overall achievement of the expectations for the course  
and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart  
for the discipline.

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every  
course in which the student s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in  
Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows:

Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout  
the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student s most consistent  
level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should  
be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an  
examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to   
the course content and administered towards the end of the course.

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS
-----------------------------------------

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in  
every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization,  
Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale   
(E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation  
and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students   
achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of  
learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation  
in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades.

MINISTRY RESOURCES
------------------

The Ministry of Education has produced or supported the production of a variety of  
resource documents that teachers may find helpful as they plan programs based on the  
expectations outlined in this curriculum document. Those resources include the following:

www.edu.gov.on.ca.

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the premise that *all students can be successful languagelearners
-----------------------------------------------*. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality  
instruction. 

Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students strengths and address their  
learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose  
for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for   
individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and  
model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and  
learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practise and  
apply their developing knowledge and skills.

SOME

CONSIDERATIONS FOR

PROGRAM PLANNING 



  

Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills  
and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fair-  
ness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

Motivating students and instilling positive habits of mind, such as a willingness and  
determination to persist, to think and communicate with clarity and precision, to take  
responsible risks, and to question and pose problems, are also integral to high-quality  
language instruction.

Language is best learned through activities that present stimulating ideas, issues, and  
themes that are meaningful to students. Since no single instructional approach can meet  
all the needs of each learner, teachers select classroom activities that are based on an  
assessment of students individual needs, proven learning theory, and best practices. In  
effective English programs, teachers introduce a rich variety of activities that integrate  
expectations from different strands and provide for the explicit teaching of knowledge  
and skills. They also provide frequent opportunities for students to rehearse, practise, and  
apply skills and strategies, and to make their own choices. 

PLANNING ENGLISH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs.  
They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with  
special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. *Special EducationTransformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table onSpecial Education, 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for  
students with special education needs *in all disciplines
------------------*. Those beliefs are as follows:

All students can succeed. 

Universal design and differentiated instruction are effective and interconnected  
means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students.

Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research,   
tempered by experience.

Classroom teachers are key educators for a student s literacy and numeracy   
development.

Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning.

Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning  
environment that supports students with special education needs.

Fairness is not sameness. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and  
needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance  
tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest pos-  
sible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for  
instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs  
that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.

In planning English courses for students with special education needs, teachers should  
begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

English

and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are  
expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the fol-  
lowing options is appropriate for the student: 

no accommodations

6 or modifications; or 

accommodations only; or 

modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or

alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations  
for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the rele-  
vant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or  
her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs  
for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative  
programs and/or courses, can be found in *The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A ResourceGuide, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*). For a detailed discussion  
of the ministry s requirements for IEPs, see *Individual Education Plans: Standards forDevelopment, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as *IEPStandards, 2000
------------------*). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only
--------------------------------------

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course  
curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to  
the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student s learning must be  
identified in his or her IEP (see *IEP Standards, 2000
-------------------*, page 11). A student s IEP is likely to  
reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first  
option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design  
and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the  
diverse needs of learners.

There are three types of accommodations:

*Instructional accommodations
----------------------------*are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of  
presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 

*Environmental accommodations
----------------------------*are changes that the student may require in the class-  
room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 

*Assessment accommodations
-------------------------*are changes in assessment procedures that enable the  
student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to  
complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see  
page 29 of the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*, for more examples). 

If a student requires accommodations only in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expecta-  
tions and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student s  
Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of  
accommodations will be included.

6. Accommodations refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or   
individualized equipment.



  

Students Requiring Modified Expectations
----------------------------------------

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course  
expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular  
course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations.  
Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achieve-  
ments and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate  
independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student s IEP, the extent to which  
expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry s policy docu-  
ment *Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, the  
principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes  
successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to  
receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and  
the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course,  
the modified expectations should identify *how the required knowledge and skills differ fromthose identified in the course expectations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*. When modifications are so extensive that achieve-  
ment of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely  
to result in a credit, the expectations should *specify the precise requirements or tasks on whichthe student s performance will be evaluated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*and which will be used to generate the course  
mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate and have assessed *in each reporting period
------------------------*(*IEP Standards, 2000,
--------------------*pages 10 and 11).  
The student s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student s progress  
at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (*IEP Standards,2000
------------------*, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP  
and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student s learn-  
ing expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for  
the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If,  
however, the student s learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the prin-  
cipal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked  
and the appropriate statement from the *Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12,1999
-----------------------------------------------------*(page 8) must be inserted. The teacher s comments should include relevant informa-  
tion on the student s demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next  
steps for the student s learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
----------------------------------------------------

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The  
first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario s English language  
schools is a language other than English. Ontario s linguistic heritage includes several  
Aboriginal languages; many African, Asian, and European languages; and some varieties  
of English, such as Jamaican Creole. Many English language learners were born in  
Canada and raised in families and communities in which languages other than English

were spoken, or in which the variety of English spoken differed significantly from the  
English of Ontario classrooms. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as new-  
comers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educa-  
tional systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling  
was limited.

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic  
and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for their English lan-  
guage development.

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional  
language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge  
and experience to the classroom. These students linguistic and cultural backgrounds not  
only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in  
the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity  
into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment.

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in  
their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school,  
there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued develop-  
ment of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage  
parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foun-  
dation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers  
to find opportunities to bring students languages into the classroom, using parents and  
community members as a resource.

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive  
support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting  
their language-learning needs:

*English as a Second Language (ESL)
----------------------------------*

programs are for students born in Canada or new-

comers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English  
significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

*English Literacy Development (ELD)
----------------------------------*

programs are primarily for newcomers whose first

language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different  
from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in  
their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education  
is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills  
in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may  
also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from  
ELD instruction.

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teach-  
ers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every  
learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and  
at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language  
acquisition may go through a silent period during which they closely observe the inter-  
actions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use  
body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have

gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and  
responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nur-  
tures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When  
they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some   
students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while  
others will speak quite fluently.

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young  
children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts  
and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in  
English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student s knowledge of vocab-  
ulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language profi-  
ciency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success.  
Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to  
catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic pur-  
poses. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the language  
knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they  
require from their teachers.

Responsibility for students English-language development is shared by the classroom  
teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and  
peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language class-  
room. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of  
these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include:

modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging  
but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given  
the necessary support from the teacher; 

use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic  
organizers, scaffolding; previewing of textbooks, pre-teaching of key vocabulary;  
peer tutoring; strategic use of students first languages); 

use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual   
dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 

use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral inter-  
views, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of  
graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assess-  
ment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner  
(whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must  
be clearly indicated on the student s report card.

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students  
who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adapta-  
tions to be successful.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION Overview
-------------------------------------

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects   
of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to high  
standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of  
identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value  
and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to  
adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence,  
and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves  
and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships,  
and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools also have the opportunity to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the  
diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a  
variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members  
from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays,  
concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with  
the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach  
and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

Antidiscrimination Education in the English Program
---------------------------------------------------

Learning resources that reflect the broad range of students interests, backgrounds, cultures,  
and experiences are an important aspect of an inclusive English program. In such a program,  
learning materials involve protagonists of both sexes from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Teachers routinely use materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world cultures,  
including those of contemporary First Nations, M tis, and Inuit peoples, and make them  
available to students. Short stories, novels, magazine and newspaper articles, television  
programs, and films provide opportunities for students to explore issues relating to their  
self-identity. In inclusive programs, students are made aware of the historical, cultural,  
and political contexts for both the traditional and non-traditional gender and social roles  
represented in the materials they are studying. 

Stories, novels, informational texts, and media works relating to the immigrant experience  
provide rich thematic material for study, as well as the opportunity for students new to  
Canada to share their knowledge and experiences with others. In addition, in the context  
of the English program, both students and teachers should become aware of aspects of  
intercultural communication for example, by exploring how different cultures interpret  
the use of eye contact and body language in conversation and during presentations.

Resources should be chosen not only to reflect diversity but also on the basis of their  
appeal for both girls and boys in the classroom. Recent research has shown that many  
boys are interested in informational materials, such as manuals and graphic texts, as  
opposed to works of fiction, which are often more appealing to girls. Both sexes read  
Internet materials, such as website articles, e-mail, and chat messages, outside the class-  
room. *Me Read? No Way! A Practical Guide to Improving Boys Literacy Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------*(available on the  
Ministry of Education website) provides a number of useful literacy strategies that focus  
on engaging boys in reading and writing and that can enhance the learning environment  
for both female and male students.

The development of critical thinking skills is integral to the English curriculum. In the  
context of what is now called critical literacy , these skills include the ability to identify  
perspectives, values, and issues; detect bias; and read for implicit as well as overt mean-  
ing. In the English program, students develop the ability to detect negative bias and  
stereotypes in literary texts and informational materials. When using biased informa-  
tional texts, or literary works containing negative stereotypes, for the express purpose of  
critical analysis, teachers must take into account the potential negative impact of bias on  
students and use appropriate strategies to address students responses.

Critical literacy also involves asking questions and challenging the status quo, and leads  
students to look at issues of power and justice in society. The program empowers stu-  
dents by enabling them to express themselves and to speak out about issues that strongly  
affect them.

Literature studies and media studies also afford both students and teachers a unique  
opportunity to explore the social and emotional impact of bullying, violence, and discrim-  
ination in the form of racism, sexism, or homophobia on individuals and families.  
Teachers can help students link the understanding they gain in this regard to messages  
conveyed through the school s antibullying and violence-prevention programming.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students success  
in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

The acquisition and development of literacy skills is clearly the focus of the English cur-  
riculum, but the English program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical  
literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams,  
charts, tables, and graphs, and the English curriculum emphasizes students ability to  
interpret and use graphic texts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In English courses, students are  
encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible  
answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to  
locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, diction-  
aries, encyclopaedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised  
in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of informa-  
tion have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a  
responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropri-  
ate ways. The ability to locate, question, and validate information allows a student to  
become an independent, lifelong learner.

THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------

The school library program can help to build and transform students knowledge to support  
lifelong learning in our information- and knowledge-based society. The school library  
program supports student success across the language curriculum by encouraging students  
to read widely, teaching them to read for understanding and enjoyment, and helping them  
to improve their research skills and to use information gathered through research effectively.

The school library program enables students to:

develop a love of reading for learning and for pleasure; 

acquire an understanding of the richness and diversity of literary and informational   
texts produced in Canada and around the world; 

obtain access to programs, resources, and integrated technologies that support   
all curriculum areas; 

understand and value the role of public library systems as a resource for   
lifelong learning.

The school library program plays a key role in the development of information literacy  
and research skills. In collaboration with classroom or content-area teachers, teacher-  
librarians develop, teach, and provide students with authentic information and research  
tasks that foster learning, including the ability to:

locate, select, gather, critically evaluate, create, and communicate information;

use the information obtained to solve problems, make decisions, build knowledge,   
create personal meaning, and enrich their lives; 

communicate their findings for different audiences, using a variety of formats   
and technologies; 

use information and research with understanding, responsibility, and imagination.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can   
significantly extend and enrich teachers instructional strategies and support students   
language learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites,  
digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to  
collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on  
their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect  
students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into  
the local classroom.

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support  
and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in  
groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to museums  
and archives in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and  
projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates.

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its  
use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible  
use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to  
promote hatred.

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-  
class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to  
learning to meet diverse student needs.

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS
------------------------------------------------

Teachers planning programs in English need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of  
the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that  
enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school work  
connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text,  
Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and  
includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how  
workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are  
used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work  
habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service.  
The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students demonstration of  
these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can  
use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill  
development, and show employers what they can do. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada  
and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through  
extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills  
provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their  
jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the  
Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca.

CAREER EDUCATION
----------------

Expectations in the English program include many opportunities for students to apply  
their language skills to work-related situations, to explore educational and career options,  
and to become self-directed learners. To prepare students for the literacy demands of a  
wide array of postsecondary educational programs and careers, English courses require  
students to develop research skills, practise expository writing, and learn strategies for  
understanding informational reading materials. Making oral presentations and working  
in small groups with classmates help students express themselves confidently and work  
cooperatively with others. Regardless of their postsecondary destination, all students need  
to realize that literacy skills are employability skills. Powerful literacy skills will equip  
students to manage information technologies, communicate effectively and correctly in a  
variety of situations, and perform a variety of tasks required in most work environments.

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing,  
field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed  
in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and  
public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to  
broaden students knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields,  
including publishing, advertising, and media-related industries. In addition, students  
develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of  
employer employee relationships. Teachers of English can support their students learning  
by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access  
to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education  
and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace  
learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand  
the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part  
in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed  
for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality  
as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the  
right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be  
aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal  
safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies  
and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for  
Students in Work Education Programs (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring  
the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least  
14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing  
or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the  
minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons  
to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and  
other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry s policy  
document entitled *Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policiesand Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH-SKILLS MAJOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

English courses are well suited for inclusion in programs leading to a Specialist High-  
Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular appren-  
ticeship or workplace destinations. In an SHSM program, English courses can be bundled  
with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular  
industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education,  
including apprenticeship. English courses may also be combined with cooperative educa-  
tion credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for  
various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM pro-  
grams would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers,  
skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
----------------------------------------

Although health and safety issues are not usually associated with language education, they  
may be important when the learning involves fieldwork. Out-of-school fieldwork can  
provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students learning experiences. Teachers  
must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students health and safety.

standing of the novel? 

Interconnected Skills
---------------------

4.2
---

identify several of their skills in listening,

speaking, writing, viewing, and representing  
and explain how the skills help them read  
more effectively *(e.g., explain to a peer howpresenting or viewing a dramatization of dia-logue from a short story helped them understandthe main character in the story; report to theclass on how discussion with a partner helpedclarify or extend their understanding of a newsarticle about a local issue)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

characters would speak these lines clarify  
your interpretation of the text? Did the dis-  
cussion with your partner raise questions  
that should have been addressed in the text  
but weren t? Did your ability to interpret  
bar graphs help you grasp the argument in  
the text?

This document replaces *The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 and 10: English, 1999
------------------------------------------------------*. Beginning in  
September 2007, all English courses for Grades 9 and 10 will be based on the expectations  
outlined in this document.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
----------------------------------------------

The goal of Ontario secondary schools is to support high-quality learning while giving  
individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests.  
The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options  
outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their  
high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY, LANGUAGE, AND THEENGLISH CURRICULUM
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Literacy is about more than reading or writing it is about how we communicate in society. It is about social practices and relationships, about knowledge, language and culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Those who use literacy take it for granted but those who cannot use it are excludedfrom much communication in today s world. Indeed, it is the excluded who can bestappreciate the notion of literacy as freedom .

UNESCO, Statement for the United Nations Literacy Decade, 2003 2012

Literacy development is a communal project, and the teaching of literacy skills is embedded  
across the Ontario curriculum. However, it is the English curriculum that is dedicated to  
developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based that is, knowledge and  
skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing.

Language development is central to students intellectual, social, cultural, and emotional  
growth and must be seen as a key component of the curriculum. When students learn to  
use language, they do more than master the basic skills. They learn to value the power   
of language and to use it responsibly. They learn to express feelings and opinions and to  
support their opinions with sound arguments and evidence from research. They become  
aware of the many purposes for which language is used and the diverse forms it can take  
to serve particular purposes and audiences. They learn to use the formal language appro-  
priate for debates and essays, the narrative language of stories and novels, the figurative  
language of poetry, the technical language of instructions and manuals. They develop   
an awareness of how language is used in different formal and informal situations. They  
come to understand that language is an important medium for communicating ideas and

INTRODUCTION



  

information, expressing world views, and realizing and communicating artistic vision.  
Students learn that language can be not only used as a tool but also appreciated and enjoyed.

Language is the basis for thinking, communicating, learning, and viewing the world.  
Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact  
socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and  
demonstrate their learning. Learning to communicate with clarity and precision will help  
students to thrive in the world beyond school.

Language is a fundamental element of identity and culture. As students read and reflect  
on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,

1 they develop a deeper under-

standing of themselves and others and of the world around them. If they see themselves  
and others in the texts they study, they will be more engaged in learning and they will  
also come to appreciate the nature and value of a diverse, multicultural society. They will  
develop the ability to understand and critically interpret a range of texts and to recognize  
that a text conveys one particular perspective among many.

Language skills are developed across the curriculum and, cumulatively, through the grades.  
Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics,  
themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all  
subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability  
to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students  
develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time.  
As they move through the secondary school program, they are required to use language  
with ever-increasing accuracy and fluency in an expanding range of situations. They are  
also expected to assume responsibility for their own learning and to apply their language  
skills in more challenging and complex ways.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM
--------------------------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible  
and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners.  
The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they  
need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

Successful language learners:

understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;

communicate that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent effectively  
and with confidence;

make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts,  
and the world around them;

think critically;

understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized,  
questioned, assessed, and evaluated;

appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;

use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal  
growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

1. The word *text* is used in this document in its broadest sense, as a means of communication that uses words, graphics,  
sounds, and/or images to convey information and ideas to an audience.



  

The English curriculum takes into account that students in Ontario come from a wide  
variety of backgrounds and that every student has a unique set of perspectives, strengths,  
and needs. Instructional strategies and resources that recognize and reflect the diversity in  
the classroom and that suit individual strengths and needs are therefore critical to student  
success. Reading activities should expose students to materials that reflect the diversity of  
Canadian and world cultures, including those of Aboriginal peoples. Students also need  
to become familiar with the works of recognized writers from their own and earlier eras.  
By reading a wide range of materials and being challenged by what they read, students  
become receptive to new and widely varying ideas and perspectives, and develop their  
ability to think independently and critically.

Research has shown that when students are given opportunities to choose what they   
read and what they write about, they are more likely to discover and pursue their own  
interests. In keeping with this finding, the curriculum requires that students select some  
of the texts they read and decide on the topic, purpose, and audience for some of the  
works they produce.

Research has also shown that effective readers and writers unconsciously apply a range  
of skills and strategies as they read and write. By identifying and explicitly teaching these  
skills and strategies, teachers enable all students to become effective communicators. The  
English curriculum focuses on comprehension strategies for listening, viewing, and reading;  
on the most effective reading and writing processes; on skills and techniques for effective  
oral and written communication and for the creation of effective media texts; and on the  
language conventions needed for clear and coherent communication. In addition, it empha-  
sizes the use of higher-level thinking skills, including critical literacy skills, to enable students  
to understand, appreciate, and evaluate what they read and view at a deeper level, and to  
help them become reflective, critical, and independent learners.

In implementing this curriculum, teachers will help students to see that language skills are  
lifelong learning skills that will enable them to better understand themselves and others,  
unlock their potential as human beings, find fulfilling careers, and become responsible  
world citizens. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENGLISH PROGRAMS Students
-------------------------------------------------------

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make   
the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon  
discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and  
will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will  
find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges  
they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely impor-  
tant to these students success. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and  
learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances.

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with the language curriculum requires work,  
study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue  
opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of the  
communication process. Their understanding and skills will grow as they explore their  
world and engage in activities, for their own purposes, that involve reading, writing,

speaking, listening, viewing, and representing. Students develop their literacy skills when  
they seek out recreational reading materials and multimedia works that relate to their  
personal interests and to other subject areas, and when they engage in conversation with  
parents, peers, and teachers about what they are reading, writing, viewing, representing,  
and thinking in their daily lives.

Parents
-------

Parents

2 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show 

that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education.   
By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in  
the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This  
awareness will enhance parents ability to discuss their children s work with them, to  
communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children s progress.  
Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret  
teachers comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their   
children s learning.

Effective ways in which parents can support their children s learning include attending  
parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops and school council activities  
(including becoming a school council member), and encouraging their children to com-  
plete their assignments at home. 

In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to encourage their  
sons and daughters to take an active interest in using language for meaningful purposes  
as a regular part of their activities outside school. They might encourage them to read  
every day; take out a library membership; join a book club, a computer club, a camera  
club, or a community group; or subscribe to an age-appropriate magazine. They might  
also initiate conversations at home about what their daughters and sons are reading. 

Teachers
--------

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropri-  
ate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well  
as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers bring  
enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing  
different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student.

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide  
numerous opportunities for students to develop the literacy and language skills that will  
allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active  
citizens. The study of literature and the media provides students with an awareness and  
appreciation of the culture that surrounds, challenges, and nourishes them.

Principals
----------

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student  
has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, prin-  
cipals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms  
using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are  
made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects,  
including English, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate  
their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible  
for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving  
the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan in other words,  
for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

The English program in Grades 9 to 12 includes *compulsory courses
------------------*and *optional courses
----------------*.

The compulsory courses emphasize strong core competencies in listening, speaking, reading,  
writing, viewing, and representing. As part of their program in Grades 9 and 10, students  
must take one compulsory course in English in each grade. These courses are offered in  
two types, academic and applied.

3

One optional course is offered in the Grade 9 10 curriculum Literacy Skills: Reading and  
Writing, Grade 10. This course offers students an opportunity to enhance their literacy skills.  
It may be taken to fulfil an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional compul-  
sory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It may also be  
used, at the principal s discretion, as a substitution for one of the compulsory credits required  
in English. The Literacy Skills course is an open course.

Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and  
postsecondary goals. The course types offered in Grades 9 and 10 are defined as follows:

*Academic courses
----------------*

develop students knowledge and skills through the study of theory and

abstract problems. These courses focus on the essential concepts of a subject and explore  
related concepts as well. They incorporate practical applications as appropriate.

*Applied courses
---------------*

focus on the essential concepts of a subject, and develop students knowledge

and skills through practical applications and concrete examples. Familiar situations are  
used to illustrate ideas, and students are given more opportunities to experience hands-on  
applications of the concepts and theories they study.

*Open courses
------------*

are designed to prepare students for further study in the subject, and to

enrich their education generally. These courses comprise a set of expectations that are  
appropriate for all students.

School boards may offer a locally developed compulsory credit (LDCC) course in English  
in each of Grades 9 and 10, which may be used to meet the compulsory credit requirement  
in English for these grades.

4 The Grade 9 and 10 LDCC courses prepare students for suc-

cess in the Grade 11 English workplace preparation course.

THE PROGRAM 

IN ENGLISH

3. If the principal deems that the academic and applied courses in either Grade 9 or Grade 10 are sufficiently different,  
a student may take both courses and, on successful completion, earn a credit for each.   
4. If a student successfully completes both an LDCC course in Grade 9 or Grade 10 English and a curriculum course in English  
in the same grade, the principal may grant a credit for each course, bearing in mind that only one compulsory English credit is  
required in each grade. (The second credit can be used to meet an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional com-  
pulsory credit requirement.)

Half-Credit Courses
-------------------

The courses outlined in the Grade 9 12 English curriculum documents are designed   
as full-credit courses. However*, with the exception of Grade 12 university preparation and university/college preparation courses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses.

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instruction-  
al time, must adhere to the following conditions:

The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the  
expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be  
drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best  
enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time.

A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may  
be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both  
parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete  
both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.)

The title of each half-credit course must include the designation *Part 1
------*or *Part 2
------*. A  
half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card  
and the Ontario Student Transcript.

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described  
above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School  
October Report.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS
-----------------------

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that stu-  
dents are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in vari-  
ous other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand (or broad curriculum area) of every  
course overall expectations and specific expectations. The *overall expectations
--------------------*describe in  
general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the  
end of each course. The *specific expectations
---------------------*describe the expected knowledge and skills in  
greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered headings, or sub-  
organizers , each of which indicates the overall expectation to which the group of specific  
expectations corresponds. Each expectation in a group is identified by an expectation  
tag (a subheading) that describes the particular aspect of the overall expectation to  
which the specific expectation refers (see the illustration on page 13). 

Taken together, the overall and specific expectations represent the mandated curriculum.

In the core English curriculum (the compulsory courses offered in every grade), the *over-all expectations
---------------------*outline standard sets of knowledge and skills required for effective listen-  
ing and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. They encompass the  
types of understanding, skills, approaches, and processes that are applied by effective  
communicators of all ages and levels of development, and are therefore described in con-  
stant terms from grade to grade. The English curriculum focuses on developing the depth

and level of sophistication of students knowledge and skills associated with each of these  
key overall expectations by increasing the complexity of the texts they work with and the  
tasks they perform over time.

The *specific expectations
---------------------*reflect this progression in knowledge and skills from grade to  
grade, and also indicate differences between course types, through a combination of the  
following: (1) the wording of the expectation itself, (2) the examples that are given in  
parentheses in the expectation, and/or (3) the teacher prompts that may follow the expec-  
tation. The examples and teacher prompts help to clarify the requirements specified in the  
expectations and suggest the intended depth and level of complexity of the expectations.  
They have been developed to model appropriate practice for the particular grade and  
course type and are meant to serve as illustrations for teachers. Teachers can choose to  
use the examples and teacher prompts that are appropriate for their classrooms, or they  
may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the  
specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in  
the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the  
student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM*Compulsory Courses*
-----------------------------------------------------

The expectations in the compulsory courses of the English curriculum are organized in  
four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature  
Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. The program in all grades is designed to develop a  
range of essential skills in these four interrelated areas, built on a solid foundation of  
knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical,  
critical, and metacognitive thinking skills. Students learn best when they are encouraged  
to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations  
that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the  
four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to,  
create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in  
the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that  
blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of  
experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy  
skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

Oral Communication
------------------

Oral language is a fundamental means of communication with others and the cornerstone  
of learning in all areas. Through talk, students not only communicate information but  
also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems;  
organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings,  
and opinions. When they converse about information and ideas, they become aware not  
only of the various perspectives of other speakers and writers but also of the language  
structures and conventions they use. As students work towards achieving the expecta-  
tions for this strand, they will improve their ability to explore and communicate ideas in  
both classroom and formal speaking situations.

To develop their oral communication skills, students need numerous opportunities to listen  
and to talk about a range of subjects, including personal interests, cultural knowledge,  
school work, and current affairs. The language program should provide opportunities   
for students to engage in various thought-provoking oral activities in connection with  
expectations in all the strands for example, brainstorming to identify what they know  
about the topic of a new text they are about to read, discussing strategies for solving a  
problem in a writing assignment, presenting and defending ideas or debating issues, and  
offering informal critiques of work produced by their peers. 

Listening and speaking are essential skills for social interaction at home, at school, and   
in the community. In order for all students to benefit from the opportunities provided in the  
classroom for listening and speaking, differences in the norms and conventions associated  
with oral communication in different cultures must be taken into account. In addition,   
for some students, the notion that learning involves talk is unfamiliar, and talk that sup-  
ports learning must be explicitly taught and modelled. All students can benefit from oppor-  
tunities to improve their listening and response skills and to refine their ideas and their  
ability to express them. The Oral Communication strand focuses on the identification and  
development of the skills and strategies effective listeners and speakers use to understand  
and interact with others. It also emphasizes the use of higher-order thinking skills to   
stimulate students interest and engage them in their own learning.

Reading and Literature Studies
------------------------------

Although many students entering the Grade 9 English program are fluent, independent  
readers, some may need additional support to develop their reading skills and to monitor  
their own progress. In addition, all students need instruction to cope with the more chal-  
lenging reading demands of the secondary school curriculum, which requires students to  
consider increasingly abstract concepts and to use language structures that are more com-  
plex and vocabulary that is more specialized than in earlier grades. The English program  
will help students learn to read efficiently and to absorb information quickly. 

The English curriculum focuses on developing the knowledge and skills that will enable  
students to become effective readers. An effective reader is one who not only grasps the  
ideas communicated in a text but is able to apply them in new contexts. To do this, the  
reader must be able to think clearly, creatively, and critically about the ideas and informa-  
tion encountered in texts in order to understand, analyse, and absorb them and to recog-  
nize their relevance in other contexts. Students can develop the skills necessary to become  
effective readers by applying a range of comprehension strategies as they read and by  
reading a wide variety of texts. It is also important that they read a range of materials that  
illustrate the many uses of writing. By reading widely, students will develop a richer  
vocabulary and become more attuned to the conventions of written language. Reading  
various kinds of texts in all areas of the curriculum will also help students to discover  
what interests them most and to pursue and develop their interests and abilities.

Reading is a complex process that involves the application of various strategies before,  
during, and after reading. For example, before reading, students might prepare by identi-  
fying the purpose of the reading activity and by activating their prior knowledge about  
the topic of the text. Teachers help build the necessary background knowledge for stu-  
dents whose life experiences may not have provided them with the information they  
need to understand the text. During reading, students may use cueing systems that is,

clues from context or from their understanding of language structures and/or letter-sound  
relationships to help them solve unfamiliar words, and comprehension strategies to help  
them make meaning of the text. Comprehension strategies include predicting, visualizing,  
questioning, drawing inferences, identifying main ideas, summarizing, and monitoring  
and revising comprehension. After reading, students may analyse, synthesize, make con-  
nections, evaluate, and use other critical and creative thinking skills to achieve a deeper  
understanding of the material they have read. It is important to note that although the  
specific expectations for each grade may focus on particular strategies that emphasize  
grade-appropriate skills, they do not impose a restriction on the range of strategies students  
will apply in that grade. Teachers must use their professional judgement in deciding which  
comprehension strategies to model and teach, based on the identified learning needs of  
the students in their classrooms and on the nature of the particular texts students are reading.

Fluent, independent readers read frequently for a variety of different purposes to locate  
information, to satisfy curiosity, for enjoyment, to build vocabulary, for research, and for  
various more specifically defined purposes. The purpose for reading will be determined  
by the teacher in some cases and by the student in others. The reading program should  
include a wide variety of literary, informational, and graphic texts that engage students   
interest and imagination for example, novels; poetry; myths, fables, and folk tales; short  
stories; textbooks and books on topics in science, history, mathematics, geography, and  
other subjects; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and journals; plays and radio, film,  
or television scripts; encyclopaedia entries; graphs, charts, and diagrams in textbooks or  
magazine articles; instructions and manuals; graphic novels, comic books, and cartoons;  
newspaper articles and editorials; databases and websites; and essays and reports.  
Teachers routinely provide materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world   
cultures, including the cultures of Aboriginal peoples. Within each course and from one  
grade to another, students should be assigned texts of increasing complexity as they  
develop their reading skills, and should also have many opportunities to select their   
own reading materials. Frequent exposure to good writing will inspire students to work  
towards high standards in their own writing and will help them develop an appreciation  
for the power and beauty of the written word.

The study of literature is central in the secondary English curriculum; it offers students  
opportunities to expand their intellectual horizons and to extend and strengthen their lit-  
eracy skills. As a creative representation of life and experience, literature raises important  
questions about the human condition, now and in the past. As students increase their  
knowledge of accomplished writers and literary works, and vicariously experience times,  
events, cultures, and values different from their own, they deepen their understanding of  
the many dimensions of human thought and human experience. 

All students, regardless of their postsecondary plans, need to read a balance of exemplary  
literary, informational, and graphic texts that nourish the imagination, promote intellectu-  
al growth, contribute to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, and provide a broad range of  
language models for their own writing. They should be exposed to literary works drawn  
from many genres, historical periods, and cultures, by both female and male writers, that  
represent a wide range of perspectives and reflect the diversity of Canada and the world.

This strand helps students learn to read with understanding, to read critically, to become  
familiar with various text forms and their characteristic elements, and to recognize the  
function and effects of various text features and stylistic devices. It helps students

understand that reading is a process of constructing meaning and equips them with the  
strategies that good readers use to understand and appreciate what they read.

Writing
-------

*Writing provides students with powerful opportunities to learn about themselves andtheir connections to the world. Through writing, students organize their thoughts, rememberimportant information, solve problems, reflect on a widening range of perspectives, andlearn how to communicate effectively for specific purposes and audiences. They findtheir voice and have opportunities to explore other voices. By putting their thoughtsinto words and supporting the words with visual images in a range of media, studentsacquire knowledge and deepen their understanding of the content in all school subjects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Ministry of Education, *Literacy for Learning, 2004*, p. 79

A central goal of the Writing strand is to promote students growth as confident writers and  
researchers who can communicate competently using a range of forms and styles to suit  
specific purposes and audiences and correctly applying the conventions of language   
grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. These conventions are best learned in the  
context of meaningful and creative writing activities that allow students to develop the  
ability to think and write clearly and effectively.

Writing, from initial musings to final publication, is a complex process that involves a  
range of complementary thinking and composing skills, as well as other language  
processes, including reading, speaking, and listening. As writers compose, they consider  
their audience; make decisions about form, style, and organization; and apply their  
knowledge of language use. To develop these competencies, students need a supportive  
classroom environment, with opportunities to extend and refine their skills in using the  
writing process and doing research. At the secondary level, teachers continue to teach  
and model effective strategies and skills, as well as provide appropriate scaffolding for  
students who are building skills and working towards independence. Students need  
opportunities to apply these skills and to write daily, in many forms and genres, for a  
variety of purposes and audiences, and within different time constraints. The forms and  
genres explored may include essays, reports, short stories, poetry, scripts, journals, letters,  
biographies, children s stories, articles, reviews, pr cis, explanations, instructions, notes,  
procedures, r sum s, and advertisements. Because postsecondary institutions and  
employers require clear, well-organized writing, on demand and within strict timelines,  
students also need to learn and practise strategies for writing effectively and correctly in  
the context of in-class writing assignments and test situations.

Students benefit from opportunities to produce writing that is interesting and original and  
that reflects their capacity for independent critical thought. Writing activities that students  
find meaningful and that challenge them to think creatively about topics and concerns that  
interest them will lead to a fuller and more lasting command of the essential skills of writing. 

The overall expectations in this strand focus on the elements of effective writing  
(ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, language conventions,  
and presentation) and on the stages of the recursive writing process (planning for writing,  
drafting, revising, editing and proofreading, and publishing). In the specific expectations,  
the examples and teacher prompts refer to writing forms and language conventions that  
are appropriate for instruction in the given course. The forms and conventions noted are  
not, however, the only ones that may be taught in the course, nor are they exclusive to the

course. Teachers will continue to make professional decisions about which writing forms  
and language conventions they will cover in every course, based on the identified learning  
needs of the students in their classrooms. 

Media Studies
-------------

Media Studies focuses on the art, meaning, and messaging of various forms of media texts.  
Media texts can be understood to include any work, object, or event that communicates  
meaning to an audience. Most media texts use words, graphics, sounds, and/or images, in  
print, oral, visual, or electronic form, to communicate information and ideas to their audi-  
ence. Whereas traditional English language study may be seen to focus primarily on the  
understanding of the word, media studies focuses on the construction of meaning through  
the combination of several media languages images, sounds, graphics, and words.

Media Studies explores the impact and influence of mass media and popular culture by  
examining texts such as films, songs, video games, action figures, advertisements, CD  
covers, clothing, billboards, television shows, magazines, newspapers, photographs, and  
websites.

5 These texts abound in our electronic information age, and the messages they

convey, both overt and implied, can have a significant influence on students lives. For  
this reason, critical thinking as it applies to media products and messages assumes a   
special significance. Understanding how media texts are constructed and why they are  
produced enables students to respond to them intelligently and responsibly. Students  
must be able to differentiate between fact and opinion; evaluate the credibility of sources;  
recognize bias; be attuned to discriminatory portrayals of individuals and groups, such as  
religious or sexual minorities, people with disabilities, or seniors; and question depictions  
of violence and crime.

Students repertoire of communication skills should include the ability to critically inter-  
pret the messages they receive through the various media and to use these media to com-  
municate their own ideas effectively as well. Skills related to high-tech media such as the  
Internet, film, and television are particularly important because of the power and perva-  
sive influence these media wield in our lives and in society. Becoming conversant with  
these and other media can greatly expand the range of information sources available to  
students, and enhance potential career opportunities in the communication and entertain-  
ment industries.

To develop their media literacy skills, students should have opportunities to view,  
analyse, and discuss a wide variety of media texts and relate them to their own experi-  
ence. They should also have opportunities to use available technologies to create media  
texts of different types (e.g., computer graphics, cartoons, graphic designs and layouts,  
radio plays, short videos, web pages).

5. Teachers should make students aware that images, print materials, music, or video clips used in connection with  
tasks and assignments may be subject to copyright, and the appropriate releases should be obtained prior to use. This  
applies to items downloaded from the Internet as well.



  

This strand focuses on helping students develop the skills required to understand, create,  
and critically interpret media texts. It examines how images (both moving and still),  
sound, and words are used, independently and in combination, to create meaning. It  
explores the use and significance of particular conventions and techniques in the media  
and considers the roles of the viewer and the producer in constructing meaning in media  
texts. Students apply the knowledge and skills gained through analysis of media texts as  
they create their own texts.

In the specific expectations in this strand, the examples and teacher prompts refer to  
media forms and conventions that are appropriate for instruction in the given course.  
These are not, however, the only forms and conventions that students may explore in the  
course, nor are they exclusive to the course. Teachers will continue to use their profes-  
sional judgement to decide on the forms and conventions students will study in every  
course, based on the identified learning needs of the students in their classrooms.

*Optional Courses
----------------*The expectations in the optional courses in the English program are clustered in strands  
suited to the particular theme or focus of the course. 

The Grade 10 optional course, Literacy Skills: Reading and Writing, contains two strands:  
Reading Skills and Writing Skills.

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information  
gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses  
in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also  
serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students   
needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices.

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including  
assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects  
how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of  
assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts  
towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student  
work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and  
the achievement levels outlined in this document.

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they  
lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evalua-  
tion strategies that:

address both what students learn and how well they learn;

are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement  
level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 24 25; 

are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide  
opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 

are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the  
needs and experiences of the students;

are fair to all students; 

accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with  
the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 

accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction  
(English or French);

ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 

promote students ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 

include the use of samples of students work that provide evidence of   
their achievement; 

are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or  
the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses  
on students achievement of the overall expectations. A student s achievement of the  
overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific  
expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations  
define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the over-  
all expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which spe-  
cific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and  
which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observa-  
tion) but not necessarily evaluated.

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 24 25) for level 3 represent the  
 provincial standard for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture  
of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in English can be constructed by reading  
from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed 70 79%  
(Level 3) . Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will  
be prepared for work in subsequent courses.

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still  
reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard.  
Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that  
achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond  
those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or  
almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability  
to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student  
achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR ENGLISH
---------------------------------

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in  
English. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers.  
It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear per-  
formance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to:

provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for   
all courses outlined in this document; 

guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 

help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 

assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students;

provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate   
students learning.

Categories of Knowledge and Skills
----------------------------------

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and  
skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four  
categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and intercon-  
nectedness of learning.

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows:

*Knowledge and Understanding.
----------------------------*

Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowl-

edge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

*Thinking.
---------*

The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:

planning skills (e.g., generating ideas, gathering information, focusing research,  
organizing information)

processing skills (e.g., drawing inferences, interpreting, analysing, synthesizing,  
evaluating)

critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., oral discourse, research, critical analysis,  
critical literacy, metacognition, creative process)

*Communication.
--------------*

The conveying of meaning through various text forms.

*Application.
------------*

The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between

various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced man-  
ner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is  
considered within the appropriate categories.

Criteria
--------

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of  
the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and  
Understanding, the criteria are knowledge of content (e.g., forms of text; strategies used  
when listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing; elements of  
style; literary terminology, concepts, and theories; language conventions) and under-  
standing of content (e.g., concepts; ideas; opinions; relationships among facts, ideas, con-  
cepts, themes) . The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed  
and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for.

Descriptors
-----------

A descriptor indicates the characteristic of the student s performance, with respect to   
a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement  
chart, *effectiveness
-------------*is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication,  
and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task  
will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may  
therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic,  
relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particu-  
lar criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might  
focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication  
category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in  
the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections.  
Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might  
focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an  
explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific  
knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better under-  
stand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated.

Qualifiers
----------

A specific qualifier is used to define each of the four levels of achievement that is,  
*limited
-------*for level 1, *some
----*for level 2, *considerable
------------*for level 3, and a *high degree
-----------*or *thorough
--------*for  
level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of perform-  
ance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student s performance at   
level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: the student  
uses planning skills with *considerable
------------*effectiveness . 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify  
the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, stu-  
dents should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent  
of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowl-  
edge and skills.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means  
of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12. The report card provides a record of the stu-  
dent s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in  
the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade rep-  
resents the quality of the student s overall achievement of the expectations for the course  
and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart  
for the discipline.

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every  
course in which the student s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in  
Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows:

Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout  
the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student s most consistent  
level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should  
be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an  
examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to   
the course content and administered towards the end of the course.

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS
-----------------------------------------

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in  
every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization,  
Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale   
(E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation  
and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students   
achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of  
learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation  
in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades.

MINISTRY RESOURCES
------------------

The Ministry of Education has produced or supported the production of a variety of  
resource documents that teachers may find helpful as they plan programs based on the  
expectations outlined in this curriculum document. Those resources include the following:

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the premise that *all students can be successful languagelearners
-----------------------------------------------*. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality  
instruction. 

Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students strengths and address their  
learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose  
for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for   
individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and  
model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and  
learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practise and  
apply their developing knowledge and skills.

SOME

CONSIDERATIONS FOR

PROGRAM PLANNING 



  

Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills  
and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fair-  
ness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

Motivating students and instilling positive habits of mind, such as a willingness and  
determination to persist, to think and communicate with clarity and precision, to take  
responsible risks, and to question and pose problems, are also integral to high-quality  
language instruction.

Language is best learned through activities that present stimulating ideas, issues, and  
themes that are meaningful to students. Since no single instructional approach can meet  
all the needs of each learner, teachers select classroom activities that are based on an  
assessment of students individual needs, proven learning theory, and best practices. In  
effective English programs, teachers introduce a rich variety of activities that integrate  
expectations from different strands and provide for the explicit teaching of knowledge  
and skills. They also provide frequent opportunities for students to rehearse, practise, and  
apply skills and strategies, and to make their own choices. 

PLANNING ENGLISH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs.  
They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with  
special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. *Special EducationTransformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table onSpecial Education, 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for  
students with special education needs *in all disciplines
------------------*. Those beliefs are as follows:

All students can succeed. 

Universal design and differentiated instruction are effective and interconnected  
means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students.

Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research,   
tempered by experience.

Classroom teachers are key educators for a student s literacy and numeracy   
development.

Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning.

Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning  
environment that supports students with special education needs.

Fairness is not sameness. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and  
needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance  
tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest pos-  
sible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for  
instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs  
that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.

In planning English courses for students with special education needs, teachers should  
begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

English

and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are  
expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the fol-  
lowing options is appropriate for the student: 

no accommodations

6 or modifications; or 

accommodations only; or 

modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or

alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations  
for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the rele-  
vant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or  
her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs  
for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative  
programs and/or courses, can be found in *The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A ResourceGuide, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*). For a detailed discussion  
of the ministry s requirements for IEPs, see *Individual Education Plans: Standards forDevelopment, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as *IEPStandards, 2000
------------------*). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only
--------------------------------------

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course  
curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to  
the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student s learning must be  
identified in his or her IEP (see *IEP Standards, 2000
-------------------*, page 11). A student s IEP is likely to  
reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first  
option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design  
and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the  
diverse needs of learners.

There are three types of accommodations:

*Instructional accommodations
----------------------------*are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of  
presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 

*Environmental accommodations
----------------------------*are changes that the student may require in the class-  
room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 

*Assessment accommodations
-------------------------*are changes in assessment procedures that enable the  
student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to  
complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see  
page 29 of the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*, for more examples). 

If a student requires accommodations only in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expecta-  
tions and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student s  
Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of  
accommodations will be included.

6. Accommodations refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or   
individualized equipment.



  

Students Requiring Modified Expectations
----------------------------------------

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course  
expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular  
course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations.  
Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achieve-  
ments and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate  
independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student s IEP, the extent to which  
expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry s policy docu-  
ment *Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, the  
principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes  
successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to  
receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and  
the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course,  
the modified expectations should identify *how the required knowledge and skills differ fromthose identified in the course expectations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*. When modifications are so extensive that achieve-  
ment of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely  
to result in a credit, the expectations should *specify the precise requirements or tasks on whichthe student s performance will be evaluated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*and which will be used to generate the course  
mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate and have assessed *in each reporting period
------------------------*(*IEP Standards, 2000,
--------------------*pages 10 and 11).  
The student s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student s progress  
at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (*IEP Standards,2000
------------------*, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP  
and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student s learn-  
ing expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for  
the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If,  
however, the student s learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the prin-  
cipal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked  
and the appropriate statement from the *Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12,1999
-----------------------------------------------------*(page 8) must be inserted. The teacher s comments should include relevant informa-  
tion on the student s demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next  
steps for the student s learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
----------------------------------------------------

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The  
first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario s English language  
schools is a language other than English. Ontario s linguistic heritage includes several  
Aboriginal languages; many African, Asian, and European languages; and some varieties  
of English, such as Jamaican Creole. Many English language learners were born in  
Canada and raised in families and communities in which languages other than English

were spoken, or in which the variety of English spoken differed significantly from the  
English of Ontario classrooms. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as new-  
comers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educa-  
tional systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling  
was limited.

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic  
and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for their English lan-  
guage development.

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional  
language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge  
and experience to the classroom. These students linguistic and cultural backgrounds not  
only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in  
the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity  
into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment.

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in  
their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school,  
there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued develop-  
ment of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage  
parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foun-  
dation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers  
to find opportunities to bring students languages into the classroom, using parents and  
community members as a resource.

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive  
support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting  
their language-learning needs:

*English as a Second Language (ESL)
----------------------------------*

programs are for students born in Canada or new-

comers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English  
significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

*English Literacy Development (ELD)
----------------------------------*

programs are primarily for newcomers whose first

language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different  
from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in  
their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education  
is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills  
in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may  
also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from  
ELD instruction.

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teach-  
ers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every  
learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and  
at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language  
acquisition may go through a silent period during which they closely observe the inter-  
actions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use  
body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have

gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and  
responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nur-  
tures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When  
they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some   
students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while  
others will speak quite fluently.

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young  
children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts  
and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in  
English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student s knowledge of vocab-  
ulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language profi-  
ciency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success.  
Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to  
catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic pur-  
poses. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the language  
knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they  
require from their teachers.

Responsibility for students English-language development is shared by the classroom  
teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and  
peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language class-  
room. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of  
these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include:

modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging  
but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given  
the necessary support from the teacher; 

use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic  
organizers, scaffolding; previewing of textbooks, pre-teaching of key vocabulary;  
peer tutoring; strategic use of students first languages); 

use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual   
dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 

use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral inter-  
views, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of  
graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assess-  
ment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner  
(whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must  
be clearly indicated on the student s report card.

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students  
who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adapta-  
tions to be successful.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION Overview
-------------------------------------

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects   
of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to high  
standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of  
identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value  
and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to  
adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence,  
and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves  
and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships,  
and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools also have the opportunity to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the  
diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a  
variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members  
from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays,  
concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with  
the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach  
and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

Antidiscrimination Education in the English Program
---------------------------------------------------

Learning resources that reflect the broad range of students interests, backgrounds, cultures,  
and experiences are an important aspect of an inclusive English program. In such a program,  
learning materials involve protagonists of both sexes from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Teachers routinely use materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world cultures,  
including those of contemporary First Nations, M tis, and Inuit peoples, and make them  
available to students. Short stories, novels, magazine and newspaper articles, television  
programs, and films provide opportunities for students to explore issues relating to their  
self-identity. In inclusive programs, students are made aware of the historical, cultural,  
and political contexts for both the traditional and non-traditional gender and social roles  
represented in the materials they are studying. 

Stories, novels, informational texts, and media works relating to the immigrant experience  
provide rich thematic material for study, as well as the opportunity for students new to  
Canada to share their knowledge and experiences with others. In addition, in the context  
of the English program, both students and teachers should become aware of aspects of  
intercultural communication for example, by exploring how different cultures interpret  
the use of eye contact and body language in conversation and during presentations.

Resources should be chosen not only to reflect diversity but also on the basis of their  
appeal for both girls and boys in the classroom. Recent research has shown that many  
boys are interested in informational materials, such as manuals and graphic texts, as  
opposed to works of fiction, which are often more appealing to girls. Both sexes read  
Internet materials, such as website articles, e-mail, and chat messages, outside the class-  
room. *Me Read? No Way! A Practical Guide to Improving Boys Literacy Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------*(available on the  
Ministry of Education website) provides a number of useful literacy strategies that focus  
on engaging boys in reading and writing and that can enhance the learning environment  
for both female and male students.

The development of critical thinking skills is integral to the English curriculum. In the  
context of what is now called critical literacy , these skills include the ability to identify  
perspectives, values, and issues; detect bias; and read for implicit as well as overt mean-  
ing. In the English program, students develop the ability to detect negative bias and  
stereotypes in literary texts and informational materials. When using biased informa-  
tional texts, or literary works containing negative stereotypes, for the express purpose of  
critical analysis, teachers must take into account the potential negative impact of bias on  
students and use appropriate strategies to address students responses.

Critical literacy also involves asking questions and challenging the status quo, and leads  
students to look at issues of power and justice in society. The program empowers stu-  
dents by enabling them to express themselves and to speak out about issues that strongly  
affect them.

Literature studies and media studies also afford both students and teachers a unique  
opportunity to explore the social and emotional impact of bullying, violence, and discrim-  
ination in the form of racism, sexism, or homophobia on individuals and families.  
Teachers can help students link the understanding they gain in this regard to messages  
conveyed through the school s antibullying and violence-prevention programming.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students success  
in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

The acquisition and development of literacy skills is clearly the focus of the English cur-  
riculum, but the English program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical  
literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams,  
charts, tables, and graphs, and the English curriculum emphasizes students ability to  
interpret and use graphic texts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In English courses, students are  
encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible  
answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to  
locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, diction-  
aries, encyclopaedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised  
in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of informa-  
tion have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a  
responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropri-  
ate ways. The ability to locate, question, and validate information allows a student to  
become an independent, lifelong learner.

THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------

The school library program can help to build and transform students knowledge to support  
lifelong learning in our information- and knowledge-based society. The school library  
program supports student success across the language curriculum by encouraging students  
to read widely, teaching them to read for understanding and enjoyment, and helping them  
to improve their research skills and to use information gathered through research effectively.

--------------------------------------

The school library program enables students to:

develop a love of reading for learning and for pleasure; 

acquire an understanding of the richness and diversity of literary and informational   
texts produced in Canada and around the world; 

obtain access to programs, resources, and integrated technologies that support   
all curriculum areas; 

understand and value the role of public library systems as a resource for   
lifelong learning.

The school library program plays a key role in the development of information literacy  
and research skills. In collaboration with classroom or content-area teachers, teacher-  
librarians develop, teach, and provide students with authentic information and research  
tasks that foster learning, including the ability to:

locate, select, gather, critically evaluate, create, and communicate information;

use the information obtained to solve problems, make decisions, build knowledge,   
create personal meaning, and enrich their lives; 

communicate their findings for different audiences, using a variety of formats   
and technologies; 

use information and research with understanding, responsibility, and imagination.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can   
significantly extend and enrich teachers instructional strategies and support students   
language learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites,  
digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to  
collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on  
their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect  
students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into  
the local classroom.

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support  
and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in  
groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to museums  
and archives in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and  
projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates.

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its  
use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible  
use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to  
promote hatred.

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-  
class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to  
learning to meet diverse student needs.

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS
------------------------------------------------

Teachers planning programs in English need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of  
the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that  
enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school work  
connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text,  
Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and  
includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how  
workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are  
used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work  
habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service.  
The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students demonstration of  
these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can  
use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill  
development, and show employers what they can do. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada  
and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through  
extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills  
provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their  
jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the  
Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca.

CAREER EDUCATION
----------------

Expectations in the English program include many opportunities for students to apply  
their language skills to work-related situations, to explore educational and career options,  
and to become self-directed learners. To prepare students for the literacy demands of a  
wide array of postsecondary educational programs and careers, English courses require  
students to develop research skills, practise expository writing, and learn strategies for  
understanding informational reading materials. Making oral presentations and working  
in small groups with classmates help students express themselves confidently and work  
cooperatively with others. Regardless of their postsecondary destination, all students need  
to realize that literacy skills are employability skills. Powerful literacy skills will equip  
students to manage information technologies, communicate effectively and correctly in a  
variety of situations, and perform a variety of tasks required in most work environments.

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing,  
field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed  
in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and  
public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to  
broaden students knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields,  
including publishing, advertising, and media-related industries. In addition, students  
develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of  
employer employee relationships. Teachers of English can support their students learning  
by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access  
to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education  
and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace  
learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand  
the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part  
in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed  
for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality  
as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the  
right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be  
aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal  
safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies  
and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for  
Students in Work Education Programs (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring  
the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least  
14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing  
or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the  
minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons  
to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and  
other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry s policy  
document entitled *Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policiesand Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH-SKILLS MAJOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

English courses are well suited for inclusion in programs leading to a Specialist High-  
Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular appren-  
ticeship or workplace destinations. In an SHSM program, English courses can be bundled  
with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular  
industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education,  
including apprenticeship. English courses may also be combined with cooperative educa-  
tion credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for  
various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM pro-  
grams would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers,  
skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
----------------------------------------

Although health and safety issues are not usually associated with language education, they  
may be important when the learning involves fieldwork. Out-of-school fieldwork can  
provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students learning experiences. Teachers  
must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students health and safety.

This document replaces *The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 and 10: English, 1999
------------------------------------------------------*. Beginning in  
September 2007, all English courses for Grades 9 and 10 will be based on the expectations  
outlined in this document.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
----------------------------------------------

The goal of Ontario secondary schools is to support high-quality learning while giving  
individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests.  
The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options  
outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their  
high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY, LANGUAGE, AND THEENGLISH CURRICULUM
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Literacy is about more than reading or writing it is about how we communicate in society. It is about social practices and relationships, about knowledge, language and culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Those who use literacy take it for granted but those who cannot use it are excludedfrom much communication in today s world. Indeed, it is the excluded who can bestappreciate the notion of literacy as freedom .

UNESCO, Statement for the United Nations Literacy Decade, 2003 2012

Literacy development is a communal project, and the teaching of literacy skills is embedded  
across the Ontario curriculum. However, it is the English curriculum that is dedicated to  
developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based that is, knowledge and  
skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing.

Language development is central to students intellectual, social, cultural, and emotional  
growth and must be seen as a key component of the curriculum. When students learn to  
use language, they do more than master the basic skills. They learn to value the power   
of language and to use it responsibly. They learn to express feelings and opinions and to  
support their opinions with sound arguments and evidence from research. They become  
aware of the many purposes for which language is used and the diverse forms it can take  
to serve particular purposes and audiences. They learn to use the formal language appro-  
priate for debates and essays, the narrative language of stories and novels, the figurative  
language of poetry, the technical language of instructions and manuals. They develop   
an awareness of how language is used in different formal and informal situations. They  
come to understand that language is an important medium for communicating ideas and

INTRODUCTION



  

information, expressing world views, and realizing and communicating artistic vision.  
Students learn that language can be not only used as a tool but also appreciated and enjoyed.

Language is the basis for thinking, communicating, learning, and viewing the world.  
Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact  
socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and  
demonstrate their learning. Learning to communicate with clarity and precision will help  
students to thrive in the world beyond school.

Language is a fundamental element of identity and culture. As students read and reflect  
on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,

1 they develop a deeper under-

standing of themselves and others and of the world around them. If they see themselves  
and others in the texts they study, they will be more engaged in learning and they will  
also come to appreciate the nature and value of a diverse, multicultural society. They will  
develop the ability to understand and critically interpret a range of texts and to recognize  
that a text conveys one particular perspective among many.

Language skills are developed across the curriculum and, cumulatively, through the grades.  
Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics,  
themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all  
subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability  
to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students  
develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time.  
As they move through the secondary school program, they are required to use language  
with ever-increasing accuracy and fluency in an expanding range of situations. They are  
also expected to assume responsibility for their own learning and to apply their language  
skills in more challenging and complex ways.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM
--------------------------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible  
and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners.  
The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they  
need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

Successful language learners:

understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;

communicate that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent effectively  
and with confidence;

make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts,  
and the world around them;

think critically;

understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized,  
questioned, assessed, and evaluated;

appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;

use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal  
growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

1. The word *text* is used in this document in its broadest sense, as a means of communication that uses words, graphics,  
sounds, and/or images to convey information and ideas to an audience.



  

The English curriculum takes into account that students in Ontario come from a wide  
variety of backgrounds and that every student has a unique set of perspectives, strengths,  
and needs. Instructional strategies and resources that recognize and reflect the diversity in  
the classroom and that suit individual strengths and needs are therefore critical to student  
success. Reading activities should expose students to materials that reflect the diversity of  
Canadian and world cultures, including those of Aboriginal peoples. Students also need  
to become familiar with the works of recognized writers from their own and earlier eras.  
By reading a wide range of materials and being challenged by what they read, students  
become receptive to new and widely varying ideas and perspectives, and develop their  
ability to think independently and critically.

Research has shown that when students are given opportunities to choose what they   
read and what they write about, they are more likely to discover and pursue their own  
interests. In keeping with this finding, the curriculum requires that students select some  
of the texts they read and decide on the topic, purpose, and audience for some of the  
works they produce.

Research has also shown that effective readers and writers unconsciously apply a range  
of skills and strategies as they read and write. By identifying and explicitly teaching these  
skills and strategies, teachers enable all students to become effective communicators. The  
English curriculum focuses on comprehension strategies for listening, viewing, and reading;  
on the most effective reading and writing processes; on skills and techniques for effective  
oral and written communication and for the creation of effective media texts; and on the  
language conventions needed for clear and coherent communication. In addition, it empha-  
sizes the use of higher-level thinking skills, including critical literacy skills, to enable students  
to understand, appreciate, and evaluate what they read and view at a deeper level, and to  
help them become reflective, critical, and independent learners.

In implementing this curriculum, teachers will help students to see that language skills are  
lifelong learning skills that will enable them to better understand themselves and others,  
unlock their potential as human beings, find fulfilling careers, and become responsible  
world citizens. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENGLISH PROGRAMS Students
-------------------------------------------------------

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make   
the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon  
discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and  
will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will  
find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges  
they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely impor-  
tant to these students success. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and  
learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances.

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with the language curriculum requires work,  
study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue  
opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of the  
communication process. Their understanding and skills will grow as they explore their  
world and engage in activities, for their own purposes, that involve reading, writing,

speaking, listening, viewing, and representing. Students develop their literacy skills when  
they seek out recreational reading materials and multimedia works that relate to their  
personal interests and to other subject areas, and when they engage in conversation with  
parents, peers, and teachers about what they are reading, writing, viewing, representing,  
and thinking in their daily lives.

Parents
-------

Parents

2 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show 

that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education.   
By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in  
the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This  
awareness will enhance parents ability to discuss their children s work with them, to  
communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children s progress.  
Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret  
teachers comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their   
children s learning.

Effective ways in which parents can support their children s learning include attending  
parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops and school council activities  
(including becoming a school council member), and encouraging their children to com-  
plete their assignments at home. 

In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to encourage their  
sons and daughters to take an active interest in using language for meaningful purposes  
as a regular part of their activities outside school. They might encourage them to read  
every day; take out a library membership; join a book club, a computer club, a camera  
club, or a community group; or subscribe to an age-appropriate magazine. They might  
also initiate conversations at home about what their daughters and sons are reading. 

Teachers
--------

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropri-  
ate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well  
as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers bring  
enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing  
different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student.

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide  
numerous opportunities for students to develop the literacy and language skills that will  
allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active  
citizens. The study of literature and the media provides students with an awareness and  
appreciation of the culture that surrounds, challenges, and nourishes them.

Principals
----------

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student  
has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, prin-  
cipals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms  
using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are  
made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects,  
including English, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate  
their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible  
for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving  
the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan in other words,  
for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

The English program in Grades 9 to 12 includes *compulsory courses
------------------*and *optional courses
----------------*.

The compulsory courses emphasize strong core competencies in listening, speaking, reading,  
writing, viewing, and representing. As part of their program in Grades 9 and 10, students  
must take one compulsory course in English in each grade. These courses are offered in  
two types, academic and applied.

3

One optional course is offered in the Grade 9 10 curriculum Literacy Skills: Reading and  
Writing, Grade 10. This course offers students an opportunity to enhance their literacy skills.  
It may be taken to fulfil an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional compul-  
sory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It may also be  
used, at the principal s discretion, as a substitution for one of the compulsory credits required  
in English. The Literacy Skills course is an open course.

Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and  
postsecondary goals. The course types offered in Grades 9 and 10 are defined as follows:

*Academic courses
----------------*

develop students knowledge and skills through the study of theory and

abstract problems. These courses focus on the essential concepts of a subject and explore  
related concepts as well. They incorporate practical applications as appropriate.

*Applied courses
---------------*

focus on the essential concepts of a subject, and develop students knowledge

and skills through practical applications and concrete examples. Familiar situations are  
used to illustrate ideas, and students are given more opportunities to experience hands-on  
applications of the concepts and theories they study.

*Open courses
------------*

are designed to prepare students for further study in the subject, and to

enrich their education generally. These courses comprise a set of expectations that are  
appropriate for all students.

School boards may offer a locally developed compulsory credit (LDCC) course in English  
in each of Grades 9 and 10, which may be used to meet the compulsory credit requirement  
in English for these grades.

4 The Grade 9 and 10 LDCC courses prepare students for suc-

cess in the Grade 11 English workplace preparation course.

IN ENGLISH

3. If the principal deems that the academic and applied courses in either Grade 9 or Grade 10 are sufficiently different,  
a student may take both courses and, on successful completion, earn a credit for each.   
4. If a student successfully completes both an LDCC course in Grade 9 or Grade 10 English and a curriculum course in English  
in the same grade, the principal may grant a credit for each course, bearing in mind that only one compulsory English credit is  
required in each grade. (The second credit can be used to meet an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional com-  
pulsory credit requirement.)

Half-Credit Courses
-------------------

The courses outlined in the Grade 9 12 English curriculum documents are designed   
as full-credit courses. However*, with the exception of Grade 12 university preparation and university/college preparation courses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses.

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instruction-  
al time, must adhere to the following conditions:

The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the  
expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be  
drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best  
enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time.

A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may  
be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both  
parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete  
both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.)

The title of each half-credit course must include the designation *Part 1
------*or *Part 2
------*. A  
half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card  
and the Ontario Student Transcript.

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described  
above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School  
October Report.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS
-----------------------

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that stu-  
dents are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in vari-  
ous other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand (or broad curriculum area) of every  
course overall expectations and specific expectations. The *overall expectations
--------------------*describe in  
general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the  
end of each course. The *specific expectations
---------------------*describe the expected knowledge and skills in  
greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered headings, or sub-  
organizers , each of which indicates the overall expectation to which the group of specific  
expectations corresponds. Each expectation in a group is identified by an expectation  
tag (a subheading) that describes the particular aspect of the overall expectation to  
which the specific expectation refers (see the illustration on page 13). 

Taken together, the overall and specific expectations represent the mandated curriculum.

In the core English curriculum (the compulsory courses offered in every grade), the *over-all expectations
---------------------*outline standard sets of knowledge and skills required for effective listen-  
ing and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. They encompass the  
types of understanding, skills, approaches, and processes that are applied by effective  
communicators of all ages and levels of development, and are therefore described in con-  
stant terms from grade to grade. The English curriculum focuses on developing the depth

and level of sophistication of students knowledge and skills associated with each of these  
key overall expectations by increasing the complexity of the texts they work with and the  
tasks they perform over time.

The *specific expectations
---------------------*reflect this progression in knowledge and skills from grade to  
grade, and also indicate differences between course types, through a combination of the  
following: (1) the wording of the expectation itself, (2) the examples that are given in  
parentheses in the expectation, and/or (3) the teacher prompts that may follow the expec-  
tation. The examples and teacher prompts help to clarify the requirements specified in the  
expectations and suggest the intended depth and level of complexity of the expectations.  
They have been developed to model appropriate practice for the particular grade and  
course type and are meant to serve as illustrations for teachers. Teachers can choose to  
use the examples and teacher prompts that are appropriate for their classrooms, or they  
may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the  
specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in  
the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the  
student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM*Compulsory Courses*
-----------------------------------------------------

The expectations in the compulsory courses of the English curriculum are organized in  
four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature  
Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. The program in all grades is designed to develop a  
range of essential skills in these four interrelated areas, built on a solid foundation of  
knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical,  
critical, and metacognitive thinking skills. Students learn best when they are encouraged  
to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations  
that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the  
four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to,  
create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in  
the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that  
blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of  
experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy  
skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

Oral Communication
------------------

Oral language is a fundamental means of communication with others and the cornerstone  
of learning in all areas. Through talk, students not only communicate information but  
also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems;  
organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings,  
and opinions. When they converse about information and ideas, they become aware not  
only of the various perspectives of other speakers and writers but also of the language  
structures and conventions they use. As students work towards achieving the expecta-  
tions for this strand, they will improve their ability to explore and communicate ideas in  
both classroom and formal speaking situations.

To develop their oral communication skills, students need numerous opportunities to listen  
and to talk about a range of subjects, including personal interests, cultural knowledge,  
school work, and current affairs. The language program should provide opportunities   
for students to engage in various thought-provoking oral activities in connection with  
expectations in all the strands for example, brainstorming to identify what they know  
about the topic of a new text they are about to read, discussing strategies for solving a  
problem in a writing assignment, presenting and defending ideas or debating issues, and  
offering informal critiques of work produced by their peers. 

Listening and speaking are essential skills for social interaction at home, at school, and   
in the community. In order for all students to benefit from the opportunities provided in the  
classroom for listening and speaking, differences in the norms and conventions associated  
with oral communication in different cultures must be taken into account. In addition,   
for some students, the notion that learning involves talk is unfamiliar, and talk that sup-  
ports learning must be explicitly taught and modelled. All students can benefit from oppor-  
tunities to improve their listening and response skills and to refine their ideas and their  
ability to express them. The Oral Communication strand focuses on the identification and  
development of the skills and strategies effective listeners and speakers use to understand  
and interact with others. It also emphasizes the use of higher-order thinking skills to   
stimulate students interest and engage them in their own learning.

Reading and Literature Studies
------------------------------

Although many students entering the Grade 9 English program are fluent, independent  
readers, some may need additional support to develop their reading skills and to monitor  
their own progress. In addition, all students need instruction to cope with the more chal-  
lenging reading demands of the secondary school curriculum, which requires students to  
consider increasingly abstract concepts and to use language structures that are more com-  
plex and vocabulary that is more specialized than in earlier grades. The English program  
will help students learn to read efficiently and to absorb information quickly. 

The English curriculum focuses on developing the knowledge and skills that will enable  
students to become effective readers. An effective reader is one who not only grasps the  
ideas communicated in a text but is able to apply them in new contexts. To do this, the  
reader must be able to think clearly, creatively, and critically about the ideas and informa-  
tion encountered in texts in order to understand, analyse, and absorb them and to recog-  
nize their relevance in other contexts. Students can develop the skills necessary to become  
effective readers by applying a range of comprehension strategies as they read and by  
reading a wide variety of texts. It is also important that they read a range of materials that  
illustrate the many uses of writing. By reading widely, students will develop a richer  
vocabulary and become more attuned to the conventions of written language. Reading  
various kinds of texts in all areas of the curriculum will also help students to discover  
what interests them most and to pursue and develop their interests and abilities.

Reading is a complex process that involves the application of various strategies before,  
during, and after reading. For example, before reading, students might prepare by identi-  
fying the purpose of the reading activity and by activating their prior knowledge about  
the topic of the text. Teachers help build the necessary background knowledge for stu-  
dents whose life experiences may not have provided them with the information they  
need to understand the text. During reading, students may use cueing systems that is,

clues from context or from their understanding of language structures and/or letter-sound  
relationships to help them solve unfamiliar words, and comprehension strategies to help  
them make meaning of the text. Comprehension strategies include predicting, visualizing,  
questioning, drawing inferences, identifying main ideas, summarizing, and monitoring  
and revising comprehension. After reading, students may analyse, synthesize, make con-  
nections, evaluate, and use other critical and creative thinking skills to achieve a deeper  
understanding of the material they have read. It is important to note that although the  
specific expectations for each grade may focus on particular strategies that emphasize  
grade-appropriate skills, they do not impose a restriction on the range of strategies students  
will apply in that grade. Teachers must use their professional judgement in deciding which  
comprehension strategies to model and teach, based on the identified learning needs of  
the students in their classrooms and on the nature of the particular texts students are reading.

Fluent, independent readers read frequently for a variety of different purposes to locate  
information, to satisfy curiosity, for enjoyment, to build vocabulary, for research, and for  
various more specifically defined purposes. The purpose for reading will be determined  
by the teacher in some cases and by the student in others. The reading program should  
include a wide variety of literary, informational, and graphic texts that engage students   
interest and imagination for example, novels; poetry; myths, fables, and folk tales; short  
stories; textbooks and books on topics in science, history, mathematics, geography, and  
other subjects; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and journals; plays and radio, film,  
or television scripts; encyclopaedia entries; graphs, charts, and diagrams in textbooks or  
magazine articles; instructions and manuals; graphic novels, comic books, and cartoons;  
newspaper articles and editorials; databases and websites; and essays and reports.  
Teachers routinely provide materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world   
cultures, including the cultures of Aboriginal peoples. Within each course and from one  
grade to another, students should be assigned texts of increasing complexity as they  
develop their reading skills, and should also have many opportunities to select their   
own reading materials. Frequent exposure to good writing will inspire students to work  
towards high standards in their own writing and will help them develop an appreciation  
for the power and beauty of the written word.

The study of literature is central in the secondary English curriculum; it offers students  
opportunities to expand their intellectual horizons and to extend and strengthen their lit-  
eracy skills. As a creative representation of life and experience, literature raises important  
questions about the human condition, now and in the past. As students increase their  
knowledge of accomplished writers and literary works, and vicariously experience times,  
events, cultures, and values different from their own, they deepen their understanding of  
the many dimensions of human thought and human experience. 

All students, regardless of their postsecondary plans, need to read a balance of exemplary  
literary, informational, and graphic texts that nourish the imagination, promote intellectu-  
al growth, contribute to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, and provide a broad range of  
language models for their own writing. They should be exposed to literary works drawn  
from many genres, historical periods, and cultures, by both female and male writers, that  
represent a wide range of perspectives and reflect the diversity of Canada and the world.

This strand helps students learn to read with understanding, to read critically, to become  
familiar with various text forms and their characteristic elements, and to recognize the  
function and effects of various text features and stylistic devices. It helps students

understand that reading is a process of constructing meaning and equips them with the  
strategies that good readers use to understand and appreciate what they read.

Writing
-------

*Writing provides students with powerful opportunities to learn about themselves andtheir connections to the world. Through writing, students organize their thoughts, rememberimportant information, solve problems, reflect on a widening range of perspectives, andlearn how to communicate effectively for specific purposes and audiences. They findtheir voice and have opportunities to explore other voices. By putting their thoughtsinto words and supporting the words with visual images in a range of media, studentsacquire knowledge and deepen their understanding of the content in all school subjects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Ministry of Education, *Literacy for Learning, 2004*, p. 79

A central goal of the Writing strand is to promote students growth as confident writers and  
researchers who can communicate competently using a range of forms and styles to suit  
specific purposes and audiences and correctly applying the conventions of language   
grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. These conventions are best learned in the  
context of meaningful and creative writing activities that allow students to develop the  
ability to think and write clearly and effectively.

Writing, from initial musings to final publication, is a complex process that involves a  
range of complementary thinking and composing skills, as well as other language  
processes, including reading, speaking, and listening. As writers compose, they consider  
their audience; make decisions about form, style, and organization; and apply their  
knowledge of language use. To develop these competencies, students need a supportive  
classroom environment, with opportunities to extend and refine their skills in using the  
writing process and doing research. At the secondary level, teachers continue to teach  
and model effective strategies and skills, as well as provide appropriate scaffolding for  
students who are building skills and working towards independence. Students need  
opportunities to apply these skills and to write daily, in many forms and genres, for a  
variety of purposes and audiences, and within different time constraints. The forms and  
genres explored may include essays, reports, short stories, poetry, scripts, journals, letters,  
biographies, children s stories, articles, reviews, pr cis, explanations, instructions, notes,  
procedures, r sum s, and advertisements. Because postsecondary institutions and  
employers require clear, well-organized writing, on demand and within strict timelines,  
students also need to learn and practise strategies for writing effectively and correctly in  
the context of in-class writing assignments and test situations.

Students benefit from opportunities to produce writing that is interesting and original and  
that reflects their capacity for independent critical thought. Writing activities that students  
find meaningful and that challenge them to think creatively about topics and concerns that  
interest them will lead to a fuller and more lasting command of the essential skills of writing. 

The overall expectations in this strand focus on the elements of effective writing  
(ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, language conventions,  
and presentation) and on the stages of the recursive writing process (planning for writing,  
drafting, revising, editing and proofreading, and publishing). In the specific expectations,  
the examples and teacher prompts refer to writing forms and language conventions that  
are appropriate for instruction in the given course. The forms and conventions noted are  
not, however, the only ones that may be taught in the course, nor are they exclusive to the

course. Teachers will continue to make professional decisions about which writing forms  
and language conventions they will cover in every course, based on the identified learning  
needs of the students in their classrooms. 

Media Studies
-------------

Media Studies focuses on the art, meaning, and messaging of various forms of media texts.  
Media texts can be understood to include any work, object, or event that communicates  
meaning to an audience. Most media texts use words, graphics, sounds, and/or images, in  
print, oral, visual, or electronic form, to communicate information and ideas to their audi-  
ence. Whereas traditional English language study may be seen to focus primarily on the  
understanding of the word, media studies focuses on the construction of meaning through  
the combination of several media languages images, sounds, graphics, and words.

Media Studies explores the impact and influence of mass media and popular culture by  
examining texts such as films, songs, video games, action figures, advertisements, CD  
covers, clothing, billboards, television shows, magazines, newspapers, photographs, and  
websites.

5 These texts abound in our electronic information age, and the messages they

convey, both overt and implied, can have a significant influence on students lives. For  
this reason, critical thinking as it applies to media products and messages assumes a   
special significance. Understanding how media texts are constructed and why they are  
produced enables students to respond to them intelligently and responsibly. Students  
must be able to differentiate between fact and opinion; evaluate the credibility of sources;  
recognize bias; be attuned to discriminatory portrayals of individuals and groups, such as  
religious or sexual minorities, people with disabilities, or seniors; and question depictions  
of violence and crime.

Students repertoire of communication skills should include the ability to critically inter-  
pret the messages they receive through the various media and to use these media to com-  
municate their own ideas effectively as well. Skills related to high-tech media such as the  
Internet, film, and television are particularly important because of the power and perva-  
sive influence these media wield in our lives and in society. Becoming conversant with  
these and other media can greatly expand the range of information sources available to  
students, and enhance potential career opportunities in the communication and entertain-  
ment industries.

To develop their media literacy skills, students should have opportunities to view,  
analyse, and discuss a wide variety of media texts and relate them to their own experi-  
ence. They should also have opportunities to use available technologies to create media  
texts of different types (e.g., computer graphics, cartoons, graphic designs and layouts,  
radio plays, short videos, web pages).

5. Teachers should make students aware that images, print materials, music, or video clips used in connection with  
tasks and assignments may be subject to copyright, and the appropriate releases should be obtained prior to use. This  
applies to items downloaded from the Internet as well.



  

This strand focuses on helping students develop the skills required to understand, create,  
and critically interpret media texts. It examines how images (both moving and still),  
sound, and words are used, independently and in combination, to create meaning. It  
explores the use and significance of particular conventions and techniques in the media  
and considers the roles of the viewer and the producer in constructing meaning in media  
texts. Students apply the knowledge and skills gained through analysis of media texts as  
they create their own texts.

In the specific expectations in this strand, the examples and teacher prompts refer to  
media forms and conventions that are appropriate for instruction in the given course.  
These are not, however, the only forms and conventions that students may explore in the  
course, nor are they exclusive to the course. Teachers will continue to use their profes-  
sional judgement to decide on the forms and conventions students will study in every  
course, based on the identified learning needs of the students in their classrooms.

*Optional Courses
----------------*The expectations in the optional courses in the English program are clustered in strands  
suited to the particular theme or focus of the course. 

The Grade 10 optional course, Literacy Skills: Reading and Writing, contains two strands:  
Reading Skills and Writing Skills.

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information  
gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses  
in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also  
serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students   
needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices.

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including  
assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects  
how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of  
assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts  
towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student  
work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and  
the achievement levels outlined in this document.

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they  
lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evalua-  
tion strategies that:

address both what students learn and how well they learn;

are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement  
level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 24 25; 

are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide  
opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 

are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the  
needs and experiences of the students;

AND EVALUATION

are fair to all students; 

accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with  
the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 

accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction  
(English or French);

ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 

promote students ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 

include the use of samples of students work that provide evidence of   
their achievement; 

are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or  
the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses  
on students achievement of the overall expectations. A student s achievement of the  
overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific  
expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations  
define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the over-  
all expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which spe-  
cific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and  
which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observa-  
tion) but not necessarily evaluated.

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 24 25) for level 3 represent the  
 provincial standard for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture  
of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in English can be constructed by reading  
from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed 70 79%  
(Level 3) . Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will  
be prepared for work in subsequent courses.

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still  
reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard.  
Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that  
achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond  
those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or  
almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability  
to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student  
achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR ENGLISH
---------------------------------

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in  
English. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers.  
It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear per-  
formance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to:

provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for   
all courses outlined in this document; 

guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 

help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 

assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students;

provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate   
students learning.

Categories of Knowledge and Skills
----------------------------------

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and  
skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four  
categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and intercon-  
nectedness of learning.

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows:

*Knowledge and Understanding.
----------------------------*

Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowl-

edge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

*Thinking.
---------*

The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:

planning skills (e.g., generating ideas, gathering information, focusing research,  
organizing information)

processing skills (e.g., drawing inferences, interpreting, analysing, synthesizing,  
evaluating)

critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., oral discourse, research, critical analysis,  
critical literacy, metacognition, creative process)

*Communication.
--------------*

The conveying of meaning through various text forms.

*Application.
------------*

The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between

various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced man-  
ner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is  
considered within the appropriate categories.

Criteria
--------

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of  
the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and  
Understanding, the criteria are knowledge of content (e.g., forms of text; strategies used  
when listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing; elements of  
style; literary terminology, concepts, and theories; language conventions) and under-  
standing of content (e.g., concepts; ideas; opinions; relationships among facts, ideas, con-  
cepts, themes) . The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed  
and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for.

Descriptors
-----------

A descriptor indicates the characteristic of the student s performance, with respect to   
a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement  
chart, *effectiveness
-------------*is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication,  
and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task  
will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may  
therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic,  
relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particu-  
lar criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might  
focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication  
category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in  
the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections.  
Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might  
focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an  
explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific  
knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better under-  
stand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated.

Qualifiers
----------

A specific qualifier is used to define each of the four levels of achievement that is,  
*limited
-------*for level 1, *some
----*for level 2, *considerable
------------*for level 3, and a *high degree
-----------*or *thorough
--------*for  
level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of perform-  
ance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student s performance at   
level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: the student  
uses planning skills with *considerable
------------*effectiveness . 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify  
the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, stu-  
dents should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent  
of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowl-  
edge and skills.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means  
of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12. The report card provides a record of the stu-  
dent s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in  
the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade rep-  
resents the quality of the student s overall achievement of the expectations for the course  
and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart  
for the discipline.

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every  
course in which the student s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in  
Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows:

Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout  
the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student s most consistent  
level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should  
be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an  
examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to   
the course content and administered towards the end of the course.

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS
-----------------------------------------

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in  
every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization,  
Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale   
(E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation  
and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students   
achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of  
learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation  
in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades.

MINISTRY RESOURCES
------------------

The Ministry of Education has produced or supported the production of a variety of  
resource documents that teachers may find helpful as they plan programs based on the  
expectations outlined in this curriculum document. Those resources include the following:

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the premise that *all students can be successful languagelearners
-----------------------------------------------*. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality  
instruction. 

Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students strengths and address their  
learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose  
for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for   
individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and  
model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and  
learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practise and  
apply their developing knowledge and skills.

SOME

CONSIDERATIONS FOR

PROGRAM PLANNING 



  

Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills  
and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fair-  
ness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

Motivating students and instilling positive habits of mind, such as a willingness and  
determination to persist, to think and communicate with clarity and precision, to take  
responsible risks, and to question and pose problems, are also integral to high-quality  
language instruction.

Language is best learned through activities that present stimulating ideas, issues, and  
themes that are meaningful to students. Since no single instructional approach can meet  
all the needs of each learner, teachers select classroom activities that are based on an  
assessment of students individual needs, proven learning theory, and best practices. In  
effective English programs, teachers introduce a rich variety of activities that integrate  
expectations from different strands and provide for the explicit teaching of knowledge  
and skills. They also provide frequent opportunities for students to rehearse, practise, and  
apply skills and strategies, and to make their own choices. 

PLANNING ENGLISH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs.  
They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with  
special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. *Special EducationTransformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table onSpecial Education, 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for  
students with special education needs *in all disciplines
------------------*. Those beliefs are as follows:

All students can succeed. 

Universal design and differentiated instruction are effective and interconnected  
means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students.

Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research,   
tempered by experience.

Classroom teachers are key educators for a student s literacy and numeracy   
development.

Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning.

Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning  
environment that supports students with special education needs.

Fairness is not sameness. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and  
needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance  
tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest pos-  
sible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for  
instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs  
that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.

In planning English courses for students with special education needs, teachers should  
begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

English

and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are  
expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the fol-  
lowing options is appropriate for the student: 

no accommodations

6 or modifications; or 

accommodations only; or 

modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or

alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations  
for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the rele-  
vant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or  
her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs  
for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative  
programs and/or courses, can be found in *The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A ResourceGuide, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*). For a detailed discussion  
of the ministry s requirements for IEPs, see *Individual Education Plans: Standards forDevelopment, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as *IEPStandards, 2000
------------------*). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only
--------------------------------------

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course  
curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to  
the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student s learning must be  
identified in his or her IEP (see *IEP Standards, 2000
-------------------*, page 11). A student s IEP is likely to  
reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first  
option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design  
and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the  
diverse needs of learners.

There are three types of accommodations:

*Instructional accommodations
----------------------------*are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of  
presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 

*Environmental accommodations
----------------------------*are changes that the student may require in the class-  
room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 

*Assessment accommodations
-------------------------*are changes in assessment procedures that enable the  
student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to  
complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see  
page 29 of the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*, for more examples). 

If a student requires accommodations only in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expecta-  
tions and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student s  
Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of  
accommodations will be included.

6. Accommodations refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or   
individualized equipment.



  

Students Requiring Modified Expectations
----------------------------------------

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course  
expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular  
course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations.  
Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achieve-  
ments and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate  
independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student s IEP, the extent to which  
expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry s policy docu-  
ment *Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, the  
principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes  
successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to  
receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and  
the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course,  
the modified expectations should identify *how the required knowledge and skills differ fromthose identified in the course expectations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*. When modifications are so extensive that achieve-  
ment of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely  
to result in a credit, the expectations should *specify the precise requirements or tasks on whichthe student s performance will be evaluated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*and which will be used to generate the course  
mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate and have assessed *in each reporting period
------------------------*(*IEP Standards, 2000,
--------------------*pages 10 and 11).  
The student s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student s progress  
at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (*IEP Standards,2000
------------------*, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP  
and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student s learn-  
ing expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for  
the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If,  
however, the student s learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the prin-  
cipal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked  
and the appropriate statement from the *Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12,1999
-----------------------------------------------------*(page 8) must be inserted. The teacher s comments should include relevant informa-  
tion on the student s demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next  
steps for the student s learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
----------------------------------------------------

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The  
first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario s English language  
schools is a language other than English. Ontario s linguistic heritage includes several  
Aboriginal languages; many African, Asian, and European languages; and some varieties  
of English, such as Jamaican Creole. Many English language learners were born in  
Canada and raised in families and communities in which languages other than English

were spoken, or in which the variety of English spoken differed significantly from the  
English of Ontario classrooms. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as new-  
comers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educa-  
tional systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling  
was limited.

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic  
and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for their English lan-  
guage development.

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional  
language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge  
and experience to the classroom. These students linguistic and cultural backgrounds not  
only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in  
the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity  
into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment.

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in  
their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school,  
there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued develop-  
ment of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage  
parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foun-  
dation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers  
to find opportunities to bring students languages into the classroom, using parents and  
community members as a resource.

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive  
support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting  
their language-learning needs:

*English as a Second Language (ESL)
----------------------------------*

programs are for students born in Canada or new-

comers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English  
significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

*English Literacy Development (ELD)
----------------------------------*

programs are primarily for newcomers whose first

language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different  
from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in  
their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education  
is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills  
in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may  
also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from  
ELD instruction.

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teach-  
ers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every  
learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and  
at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language  
acquisition may go through a silent period during which they closely observe the inter-  
actions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use  
body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have

gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and  
responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nur-  
tures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When  
they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some   
students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while  
others will speak quite fluently.

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young  
children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts  
and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in  
English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student s knowledge of vocab-  
ulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language profi-  
ciency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success.  
Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to  
catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic pur-  
poses. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the language  
knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they  
require from their teachers.

Responsibility for students English-language development is shared by the classroom  
teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and  
peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language class-  
room. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of  
these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include:

modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging  
but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given  
the necessary support from the teacher; 

use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic  
organizers, scaffolding; previewing of textbooks, pre-teaching of key vocabulary;  
peer tutoring; strategic use of students first languages); 

use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual   
dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 

use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral inter-  
views, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of  
graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assess-  
ment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner  
(whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must  
be clearly indicated on the student s report card.

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students  
who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adapta-  
tions to be successful.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION Overview
-------------------------------------

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects   
of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to high  
standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of  
identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value  
and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to  
adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence,  
and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves  
and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships,  
and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools also have the opportunity to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the  
diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a  
variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members  
from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays,  
concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with  
the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach  
and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

Antidiscrimination Education in the English Program
---------------------------------------------------

Learning resources that reflect the broad range of students interests, backgrounds, cultures,  
and experiences are an important aspect of an inclusive English program. In such a program,  
learning materials involve protagonists of both sexes from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Teachers routinely use materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world cultures,  
including those of contemporary First Nations, M tis, and Inuit peoples, and make them  
available to students. Short stories, novels, magazine and newspaper articles, television  
programs, and films provide opportunities for students to explore issues relating to their  
self-identity. In inclusive programs, students are made aware of the historical, cultural,  
and political contexts for both the traditional and non-traditional gender and social roles  
represented in the materials they are studying. 

Stories, novels, informational texts, and media works relating to the immigrant experience  
provide rich thematic material for study, as well as the opportunity for students new to  
Canada to share their knowledge and experiences with others. In addition, in the context  
of the English program, both students and teachers should become aware of aspects of  
intercultural communication for example, by exploring how different cultures interpret  
the use of eye contact and body language in conversation and during presentations.

Resources should be chosen not only to reflect diversity but also on the basis of their  
appeal for both girls and boys in the classroom. Recent research has shown that many  
boys are interested in informational materials, such as manuals and graphic texts, as  
opposed to works of fiction, which are often more appealing to girls. Both sexes read  
Internet materials, such as website articles, e-mail, and chat messages, outside the class-  
room. *Me Read? No Way! A Practical Guide to Improving Boys Literacy Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------*(available on the  
Ministry of Education website) provides a number of useful literacy strategies that focus  
on engaging boys in reading and writing and that can enhance the learning environment  
for both female and male students.

The development of critical thinking skills is integral to the English curriculum. In the  
context of what is now called critical literacy , these skills include the ability to identify  
perspectives, values, and issues; detect bias; and read for implicit as well as overt mean-  
ing. In the English program, students develop the ability to detect negative bias and  
stereotypes in literary texts and informational materials. When using biased informa-  
tional texts, or literary works containing negative stereotypes, for the express purpose of  
critical analysis, teachers must take into account the potential negative impact of bias on  
students and use appropriate strategies to address students responses.

Critical literacy also involves asking questions and challenging the status quo, and leads  
students to look at issues of power and justice in society. The program empowers stu-  
dents by enabling them to express themselves and to speak out about issues that strongly  
affect them.

Literature studies and media studies also afford both students and teachers a unique  
opportunity to explore the social and emotional impact of bullying, violence, and discrim-  
ination in the form of racism, sexism, or homophobia on individuals and families.  
Teachers can help students link the understanding they gain in this regard to messages  
conveyed through the school s antibullying and violence-prevention programming.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students success  
in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

The acquisition and development of literacy skills is clearly the focus of the English cur-  
riculum, but the English program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical  
literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams,  
charts, tables, and graphs, and the English curriculum emphasizes students ability to  
interpret and use graphic texts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In English courses, students are  
encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible  
answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to  
locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, diction-  
aries, encyclopaedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised  
in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of informa-  
tion have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a  
responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropri-  
ate ways. The ability to locate, question, and validate information allows a student to  
become an independent, lifelong learner.

THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------

The school library program can help to build and transform students knowledge to support  
lifelong learning in our information- and knowledge-based society. The school library  
program supports student success across the language curriculum by encouraging students  
to read widely, teaching them to read for understanding and enjoyment, and helping them  
to improve their research skills and to use information gathered through research effectively. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

--



  

The school library program enables students to:

develop a love of reading for learning and for pleasure; 

acquire an understanding of the richness and diversity of literary and informational   
texts produced in Canada and around the world; 

obtain access to programs, resources, and integrated technologies that support   
all curriculum areas; 

understand and value the role of public library systems as a resource for   
lifelong learning.

The school library program plays a key role in the development of information literacy  
and research skills. In collaboration with classroom or content-area teachers, teacher-  
librarians develop, teach, and provide students with authentic information and research  
tasks that foster learning, including the ability to:

locate, select, gather, critically evaluate, create, and communicate information;

use the information obtained to solve problems, make decisions, build knowledge,   
create personal meaning, and enrich their lives; 

communicate their findings for different audiences, using a variety of formats   
and technologies; 

use information and research with understanding, responsibility, and imagination.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can   
significantly extend and enrich teachers instructional strategies and support students   
language learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites,  
digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to  
collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on  
their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect  
students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into  
the local classroom.

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support  
and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in  
groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to museums  
and archives in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and  
projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates.

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its  
use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible  
use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to  
promote hatred.

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-  
class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to  
learning to meet diverse student needs.

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS
------------------------------------------------

Teachers planning programs in English need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of  
the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that  
enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school work  
connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text,  
Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and  
includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how  
workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are  
used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work  
habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service.  
The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students demonstration of  
these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can  
use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill  
development, and show employers what they can do. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada  
and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through  
extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills  
provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their  
jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the  
Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca.

CAREER EDUCATION
----------------

Expectations in the English program include many opportunities for students to apply  
their language skills to work-related situations, to explore educational and career options,  
and to become self-directed learners. To prepare students for the literacy demands of a  
wide array of postsecondary educational programs and careers, English courses require  
students to develop research skills, practise expository writing, and learn strategies for  
understanding informational reading materials. Making oral presentations and working  
in small groups with classmates help students express themselves confidently and work  
cooperatively with others. Regardless of their postsecondary destination, all students need  
to realize that literacy skills are employability skills. Powerful literacy skills will equip  
students to manage information technologies, communicate effectively and correctly in a  
variety of situations, and perform a variety of tasks required in most work environments.

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing,  
field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed  
in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and  
public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to  
broaden students knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields,  
including publishing, advertising, and media-related industries. In addition, students  
develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of  
employer employee relationships. Teachers of English can support their students learning  
by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access  
to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education  
and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace  
learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand  
the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part  
in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed  
for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality  
as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the  
right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be  
aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal  
safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies  
and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for  
Students in Work Education Programs (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring  
the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least  
14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing  
or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the  
minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons  
to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and  
other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry s policy  
document entitled *Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policiesand Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH-SKILLS MAJOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

English courses are well suited for inclusion in programs leading to a Specialist High-  
Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular appren-  
ticeship or workplace destinations. In an SHSM program, English courses can be bundled  
with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular  
industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education,  
including apprenticeship. English courses may also be combined with cooperative educa-  
tion credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for  
various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM pro-  
grams would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers,  
skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
----------------------------------------

Although health and safety issues are not usually associated with language education, they  
may be important when the learning involves fieldwork. Out-of-school fieldwork can  
provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students learning experiences. Teachers  
must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students health and safety.

2. The media contain beliefs and 

value messages. 

3. Each person interprets messages 

differently. 

4. The media have special interests 

(commercial, ideological, political). 

5. Each medium has its own language,

style, form, techniques, conventions,  
and aesthetics.

This document replaces *The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 and 10: English, 1999
------------------------------------------------------*. Beginning in  
September 2007, all English courses for Grades 9 and 10 will be based on the expectations  
outlined in this document.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
----------------------------------------------

The goal of Ontario secondary schools is to support high-quality learning while giving  
individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests.  
The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options  
outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their  
high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY, LANGUAGE, AND THEENGLISH CURRICULUM
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Literacy is about more than reading or writing it is about how we communicate in society. It is about social practices and relationships, about knowledge, language and culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Those who use literacy take it for granted but those who cannot use it are excludedfrom much communication in today s world. Indeed, it is the excluded who can bestappreciate the notion of literacy as freedom .

UNESCO, Statement for the United Nations Literacy Decade, 2003 2012

Literacy development is a communal project, and the teaching of literacy skills is embedded  
across the Ontario curriculum. However, it is the English curriculum that is dedicated to  
developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based that is, knowledge and  
skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing.

Language development is central to students intellectual, social, cultural, and emotional  
growth and must be seen as a key component of the curriculum. When students learn to  
use language, they do more than master the basic skills. They learn to value the power   
of language and to use it responsibly. They learn to express feelings and opinions and to  
support their opinions with sound arguments and evidence from research. They become  
aware of the many purposes for which language is used and the diverse forms it can take  
to serve particular purposes and audiences. They learn to use the formal language appro-  
priate for debates and essays, the narrative language of stories and novels, the figurative  
language of poetry, the technical language of instructions and manuals. They develop   
an awareness of how language is used in different formal and informal situations. They  
come to understand that language is an important medium for communicating ideas and

INTRODUCTION



  

information, expressing world views, and realizing and communicating artistic vision.  
Students learn that language can be not only used as a tool but also appreciated and enjoyed.

Language is the basis for thinking, communicating, learning, and viewing the world.  
Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact  
socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and  
demonstrate their learning. Learning to communicate with clarity and precision will help  
students to thrive in the world beyond school.

Language is a fundamental element of identity and culture. As students read and reflect  
on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,

1 they develop a deeper under-

standing of themselves and others and of the world around them. If they see themselves  
and others in the texts they study, they will be more engaged in learning and they will  
also come to appreciate the nature and value of a diverse, multicultural society. They will  
develop the ability to understand and critically interpret a range of texts and to recognize  
that a text conveys one particular perspective among many.

Language skills are developed across the curriculum and, cumulatively, through the grades.  
Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics,  
themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all  
subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability  
to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students  
develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time.  
As they move through the secondary school program, they are required to use language  
with ever-increasing accuracy and fluency in an expanding range of situations. They are  
also expected to assume responsibility for their own learning and to apply their language  
skills in more challenging and complex ways.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM
--------------------------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible  
and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners.  
The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they  
need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

Successful language learners:

understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;

communicate that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent effectively  
and with confidence;

make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts,  
and the world around them;

think critically;

understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized,  
questioned, assessed, and evaluated;

appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;

use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal  
growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

1. The word *text* is used in this document in its broadest sense, as a means of communication that uses words, graphics,  
sounds, and/or images to convey information and ideas to an audience.



  

The English curriculum takes into account that students in Ontario come from a wide  
variety of backgrounds and that every student has a unique set of perspectives, strengths,  
and needs. Instructional strategies and resources that recognize and reflect the diversity in  
the classroom and that suit individual strengths and needs are therefore critical to student  
success. Reading activities should expose students to materials that reflect the diversity of  
Canadian and world cultures, including those of Aboriginal peoples. Students also need  
to become familiar with the works of recognized writers from their own and earlier eras.  
By reading a wide range of materials and being challenged by what they read, students  
become receptive to new and widely varying ideas and perspectives, and develop their  
ability to think independently and critically.

Research has shown that when students are given opportunities to choose what they   
read and what they write about, they are more likely to discover and pursue their own  
interests. In keeping with this finding, the curriculum requires that students select some  
of the texts they read and decide on the topic, purpose, and audience for some of the  
works they produce.

Research has also shown that effective readers and writers unconsciously apply a range  
of skills and strategies as they read and write. By identifying and explicitly teaching these  
skills and strategies, teachers enable all students to become effective communicators. The  
English curriculum focuses on comprehension strategies for listening, viewing, and reading;  
on the most effective reading and writing processes; on skills and techniques for effective  
oral and written communication and for the creation of effective media texts; and on the  
language conventions needed for clear and coherent communication. In addition, it empha-  
sizes the use of higher-level thinking skills, including critical literacy skills, to enable students  
to understand, appreciate, and evaluate what they read and view at a deeper level, and to  
help them become reflective, critical, and independent learners.

In implementing this curriculum, teachers will help students to see that language skills are  
lifelong learning skills that will enable them to better understand themselves and others,  
unlock their potential as human beings, find fulfilling careers, and become responsible  
world citizens. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENGLISH PROGRAMS Students
-------------------------------------------------------

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make   
the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon  
discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and  
will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will  
find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges  
they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely impor-  
tant to these students success. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and  
learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances.

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with the language curriculum requires work,  
study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue  
opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of the  
communication process. Their understanding and skills will grow as they explore their  
world and engage in activities, for their own purposes, that involve reading, writing,

speaking, listening, viewing, and representing. Students develop their literacy skills when  
they seek out recreational reading materials and multimedia works that relate to their  
personal interests and to other subject areas, and when they engage in conversation with  
parents, peers, and teachers about what they are reading, writing, viewing, representing,  
and thinking in their daily lives.

Parents
-------

Parents

2 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show 

that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education.   
By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in  
the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This  
awareness will enhance parents ability to discuss their children s work with them, to  
communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children s progress.  
Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret  
teachers comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their   
children s learning.

Effective ways in which parents can support their children s learning include attending  
parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops and school council activities  
(including becoming a school council member), and encouraging their children to com-  
plete their assignments at home. 

In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to encourage their  
sons and daughters to take an active interest in using language for meaningful purposes  
as a regular part of their activities outside school. They might encourage them to read  
every day; take out a library membership; join a book club, a computer club, a camera  
club, or a community group; or subscribe to an age-appropriate magazine. They might  
also initiate conversations at home about what their daughters and sons are reading. 

Teachers
--------

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropri-  
ate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well  
as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers bring  
enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing  
different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student.

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide  
numerous opportunities for students to develop the literacy and language skills that will  
allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active  
citizens. The study of literature and the media provides students with an awareness and  
appreciation of the culture that surrounds, challenges, and nourishes them.

Principals
----------

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student  
has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, prin-  
cipals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms  
using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are  
made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects,  
including English, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate  
their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible  
for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving  
the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan in other words,  
for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

The English program in Grades 9 to 12 includes *compulsory courses
------------------*and *optional courses
----------------*.

The compulsory courses emphasize strong core competencies in listening, speaking, reading,  
writing, viewing, and representing. As part of their program in Grades 9 and 10, students  
must take one compulsory course in English in each grade. These courses are offered in  
two types, academic and applied.

3

One optional course is offered in the Grade 9 10 curriculum Literacy Skills: Reading and  
Writing, Grade 10. This course offers students an opportunity to enhance their literacy skills.  
It may be taken to fulfil an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional compul-  
sory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It may also be  
used, at the principal s discretion, as a substitution for one of the compulsory credits required  
in English. The Literacy Skills course is an open course.

Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and  
postsecondary goals. The course types offered in Grades 9 and 10 are defined as follows:

*Academic courses
----------------*

develop students knowledge and skills through the study of theory and

abstract problems. These courses focus on the essential concepts of a subject and explore  
related concepts as well. They incorporate practical applications as appropriate.

*Applied courses
---------------*

focus on the essential concepts of a subject, and develop students knowledge

and skills through practical applications and concrete examples. Familiar situations are  
used to illustrate ideas, and students are given more opportunities to experience hands-on  
applications of the concepts and theories they study.

*Open courses
------------*

are designed to prepare students for further study in the subject, and to

enrich their education generally. These courses comprise a set of expectations that are  
appropriate for all students.

School boards may offer a locally developed compulsory credit (LDCC) course in English  
in each of Grades 9 and 10, which may be used to meet the compulsory credit requirement  
in English for these grades.

4 The Grade 9 and 10 LDCC courses prepare students for suc-

cess in the Grade 11 English workplace preparation course.

IN ENGLISH

3. If the principal deems that the academic and applied courses in either Grade 9 or Grade 10 are sufficiently different,  
a student may take both courses and, on successful completion, earn a credit for each.   
4. If a student successfully completes both an LDCC course in Grade 9 or Grade 10 English and a curriculum course in English  
in the same grade, the principal may grant a credit for each course, bearing in mind that only one compulsory English credit is  
required in each grade. (The second credit can be used to meet an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional com-  
pulsory credit requirement.)

Half-Credit Courses
-------------------

The courses outlined in the Grade 9 12 English curriculum documents are designed   
as full-credit courses. However*, with the exception of Grade 12 university preparation and university/college preparation courses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses.

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instruction-  
al time, must adhere to the following conditions:

The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the  
expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be  
drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best  
enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time.

A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may  
be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both  
parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete  
both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.)

The title of each half-credit course must include the designation *Part 1
------*or *Part 2
------*. A  
half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card  
and the Ontario Student Transcript.

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described  
above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School  
October Report.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS
-----------------------

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that stu-  
dents are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in vari-  
ous other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand (or broad curriculum area) of every  
course overall expectations and specific expectations. The *overall expectations
--------------------*describe in  
general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the  
end of each course. The *specific expectations
---------------------*describe the expected knowledge and skills in  
greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered headings, or sub-  
organizers , each of which indicates the overall expectation to which the group of specific  
expectations corresponds. Each expectation in a group is identified by an expectation  
tag (a subheading) that describes the particular aspect of the overall expectation to  
which the specific expectation refers (see the illustration on page 13). 

Taken together, the overall and specific expectations represent the mandated curriculum.

In the core English curriculum (the compulsory courses offered in every grade), the *over-all expectations
---------------------*outline standard sets of knowledge and skills required for effective listen-  
ing and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. They encompass the  
types of understanding, skills, approaches, and processes that are applied by effective  
communicators of all ages and levels of development, and are therefore described in con-  
stant terms from grade to grade. The English curriculum focuses on developing the depth

and level of sophistication of students knowledge and skills associated with each of these  
key overall expectations by increasing the complexity of the texts they work with and the  
tasks they perform over time.

The *specific expectations
---------------------*reflect this progression in knowledge and skills from grade to  
grade, and also indicate differences between course types, through a combination of the  
following: (1) the wording of the expectation itself, (2) the examples that are given in  
parentheses in the expectation, and/or (3) the teacher prompts that may follow the expec-  
tation. The examples and teacher prompts help to clarify the requirements specified in the  
expectations and suggest the intended depth and level of complexity of the expectations.  
They have been developed to model appropriate practice for the particular grade and  
course type and are meant to serve as illustrations for teachers. Teachers can choose to  
use the examples and teacher prompts that are appropriate for their classrooms, or they  
may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the  
specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in  
the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the  
student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM*Compulsory Courses*
-----------------------------------------------------

The expectations in the compulsory courses of the English curriculum are organized in  
four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature  
Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. The program in all grades is designed to develop a  
range of essential skills in these four interrelated areas, built on a solid foundation of  
knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical,  
critical, and metacognitive thinking skills. Students learn best when they are encouraged  
to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations  
that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the  
four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to,  
create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in  
the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that  
blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of  
experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy  
skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

Oral Communication
------------------

Oral language is a fundamental means of communication with others and the cornerstone  
of learning in all areas. Through talk, students not only communicate information but  
also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems;  
organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings,  
and opinions. When they converse about information and ideas, they become aware not  
only of the various perspectives of other speakers and writers but also of the language  
structures and conventions they use. As students work towards achieving the expecta-  
tions for this strand, they will improve their ability to explore and communicate ideas in  
both classroom and formal speaking situations. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

|

English

14
--



  

To develop their oral communication skills, students need numerous opportunities to listen  
and to talk about a range of subjects, including personal interests, cultural knowledge,  
school work, and current affairs. The language program should provide opportunities   
for students to engage in various thought-provoking oral activities in connection with  
expectations in all the strands for example, brainstorming to identify what they know  
about the topic of a new text they are about to read, discussing strategies for solving a  
problem in a writing assignment, presenting and defending ideas or debating issues, and  
offering informal critiques of work produced by their peers. 

Listening and speaking are essential skills for social interaction at home, at school, and   
in the community. In order for all students to benefit from the opportunities provided in the  
classroom for listening and speaking, differences in the norms and conventions associated  
with oral communication in different cultures must be taken into account. In addition,   
for some students, the notion that learning involves talk is unfamiliar, and talk that sup-  
ports learning must be explicitly taught and modelled. All students can benefit from oppor-  
tunities to improve their listening and response skills and to refine their ideas and their  
ability to express them. The Oral Communication strand focuses on the identification and  
development of the skills and strategies effective listeners and speakers use to understand  
and interact with others. It also emphasizes the use of higher-order thinking skills to   
stimulate students interest and engage them in their own learning.

Reading and Literature Studies
------------------------------

Although many students entering the Grade 9 English program are fluent, independent  
readers, some may need additional support to develop their reading skills and to monitor  
their own progress. In addition, all students need instruction to cope with the more chal-  
lenging reading demands of the secondary school curriculum, which requires students to  
consider increasingly abstract concepts and to use language structures that are more com-  
plex and vocabulary that is more specialized than in earlier grades. The English program  
will help students learn to read efficiently and to absorb information quickly. 

The English curriculum focuses on developing the knowledge and skills that will enable  
students to become effective readers. An effective reader is one who not only grasps the  
ideas communicated in a text but is able to apply them in new contexts. To do this, the  
reader must be able to think clearly, creatively, and critically about the ideas and informa-  
tion encountered in texts in order to understand, analyse, and absorb them and to recog-  
nize their relevance in other contexts. Students can develop the skills necessary to become  
effective readers by applying a range of comprehension strategies as they read and by  
reading a wide variety of texts. It is also important that they read a range of materials that  
illustrate the many uses of writing. By reading widely, students will develop a richer  
vocabulary and become more attuned to the conventions of written language. Reading  
various kinds of texts in all areas of the curriculum will also help students to discover  
what interests them most and to pursue and develop their interests and abilities.

Reading is a complex process that involves the application of various strategies before,  
during, and after reading. For example, before reading, students might prepare by identi-  
fying the purpose of the reading activity and by activating their prior knowledge about  
the topic of the text. Teachers help build the necessary background knowledge for stu-  
dents whose life experiences may not have provided them with the information they  
need to understand the text. During reading, students may use cueing systems that is,

clues from context or from their understanding of language structures and/or letter-sound  
relationships to help them solve unfamiliar words, and comprehension strategies to help  
them make meaning of the text. Comprehension strategies include predicting, visualizing,  
questioning, drawing inferences, identifying main ideas, summarizing, and monitoring  
and revising comprehension. After reading, students may analyse, synthesize, make con-  
nections, evaluate, and use other critical and creative thinking skills to achieve a deeper  
understanding of the material they have read. It is important to note that although the  
specific expectations for each grade may focus on particular strategies that emphasize  
grade-appropriate skills, they do not impose a restriction on the range of strategies students  
will apply in that grade. Teachers must use their professional judgement in deciding which  
comprehension strategies to model and teach, based on the identified learning needs of  
the students in their classrooms and on the nature of the particular texts students are reading.

Fluent, independent readers read frequently for a variety of different purposes to locate  
information, to satisfy curiosity, for enjoyment, to build vocabulary, for research, and for  
various more specifically defined purposes. The purpose for reading will be determined  
by the teacher in some cases and by the student in others. The reading program should  
include a wide variety of literary, informational, and graphic texts that engage students   
interest and imagination for example, novels; poetry; myths, fables, and folk tales; short  
stories; textbooks and books on topics in science, history, mathematics, geography, and  
other subjects; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and journals; plays and radio, film,  
or television scripts; encyclopaedia entries; graphs, charts, and diagrams in textbooks or  
magazine articles; instructions and manuals; graphic novels, comic books, and cartoons;  
newspaper articles and editorials; databases and websites; and essays and reports.  
Teachers routinely provide materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world   
cultures, including the cultures of Aboriginal peoples. Within each course and from one  
grade to another, students should be assigned texts of increasing complexity as they  
develop their reading skills, and should also have many opportunities to select their   
own reading materials. Frequent exposure to good writing will inspire students to work  
towards high standards in their own writing and will help them develop an appreciation  
for the power and beauty of the written word.

The study of literature is central in the secondary English curriculum; it offers students  
opportunities to expand their intellectual horizons and to extend and strengthen their lit-  
eracy skills. As a creative representation of life and experience, literature raises important  
questions about the human condition, now and in the past. As students increase their  
knowledge of accomplished writers and literary works, and vicariously experience times,  
events, cultures, and values different from their own, they deepen their understanding of  
the many dimensions of human thought and human experience. 

All students, regardless of their postsecondary plans, need to read a balance of exemplary  
literary, informational, and graphic texts that nourish the imagination, promote intellectu-  
al growth, contribute to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, and provide a broad range of  
language models for their own writing. They should be exposed to literary works drawn  
from many genres, historical periods, and cultures, by both female and male writers, that  
represent a wide range of perspectives and reflect the diversity of Canada and the world.

This strand helps students learn to read with understanding, to read critically, to become  
familiar with various text forms and their characteristic elements, and to recognize the  
function and effects of various text features and stylistic devices. It helps students

understand that reading is a process of constructing meaning and equips them with the  
strategies that good readers use to understand and appreciate what they read.

Writing
-------

*Writing provides students with powerful opportunities to learn about themselves andtheir connections to the world. Through writing, students organize their thoughts, rememberimportant information, solve problems, reflect on a widening range of perspectives, andlearn how to communicate effectively for specific purposes and audiences. They findtheir voice and have opportunities to explore other voices. By putting their thoughtsinto words and supporting the words with visual images in a range of media, studentsacquire knowledge and deepen their understanding of the content in all school subjects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Ministry of Education, *Literacy for Learning, 2004*, p. 79

A central goal of the Writing strand is to promote students growth as confident writers and  
researchers who can communicate competently using a range of forms and styles to suit  
specific purposes and audiences and correctly applying the conventions of language   
grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. These conventions are best learned in the  
context of meaningful and creative writing activities that allow students to develop the  
ability to think and write clearly and effectively.

Writing, from initial musings to final publication, is a complex process that involves a  
range of complementary thinking and composing skills, as well as other language  
processes, including reading, speaking, and listening. As writers compose, they consider  
their audience; make decisions about form, style, and organization; and apply their  
knowledge of language use. To develop these competencies, students need a supportive  
classroom environment, with opportunities to extend and refine their skills in using the  
writing process and doing research. At the secondary level, teachers continue to teach  
and model effective strategies and skills, as well as provide appropriate scaffolding for  
students who are building skills and working towards independence. Students need  
opportunities to apply these skills and to write daily, in many forms and genres, for a  
variety of purposes and audiences, and within different time constraints. The forms and  
genres explored may include essays, reports, short stories, poetry, scripts, journals, letters,  
biographies, children s stories, articles, reviews, pr cis, explanations, instructions, notes,  
procedures, r sum s, and advertisements. Because postsecondary institutions and  
employers require clear, well-organized writing, on demand and within strict timelines,  
students also need to learn and practise strategies for writing effectively and correctly in  
the context of in-class writing assignments and test situations.

Students benefit from opportunities to produce writing that is interesting and original and  
that reflects their capacity for independent critical thought. Writing activities that students  
find meaningful and that challenge them to think creatively about topics and concerns that  
interest them will lead to a fuller and more lasting command of the essential skills of writing. 

The overall expectations in this strand focus on the elements of effective writing  
(ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, language conventions,  
and presentation) and on the stages of the recursive writing process (planning for writing,  
drafting, revising, editing and proofreading, and publishing). In the specific expectations,  
the examples and teacher prompts refer to writing forms and language conventions that  
are appropriate for instruction in the given course. The forms and conventions noted are  
not, however, the only ones that may be taught in the course, nor are they exclusive to the

course. Teachers will continue to make professional decisions about which writing forms  
and language conventions they will cover in every course, based on the identified learning  
needs of the students in their classrooms. 

Media Studies
-------------

Media Studies focuses on the art, meaning, and messaging of various forms of media texts.  
Media texts can be understood to include any work, object, or event that communicates  
meaning to an audience. Most media texts use words, graphics, sounds, and/or images, in  
print, oral, visual, or electronic form, to communicate information and ideas to their audi-  
ence. Whereas traditional English language study may be seen to focus primarily on the  
understanding of the word, media studies focuses on the construction of meaning through  
the combination of several media languages images, sounds, graphics, and words.

Media Studies explores the impact and influence of mass media and popular culture by  
examining texts such as films, songs, video games, action figures, advertisements, CD  
covers, clothing, billboards, television shows, magazines, newspapers, photographs, and  
websites.

5 These texts abound in our electronic information age, and the messages they

convey, both overt and implied, can have a significant influence on students lives. For  
this reason, critical thinking as it applies to media products and messages assumes a   
special significance. Understanding how media texts are constructed and why they are  
produced enables students to respond to them intelligently and responsibly. Students  
must be able to differentiate between fact and opinion; evaluate the credibility of sources;  
recognize bias; be attuned to discriminatory portrayals of individuals and groups, such as  
religious or sexual minorities, people with disabilities, or seniors; and question depictions  
of violence and crime.

Students repertoire of communication skills should include the ability to critically inter-  
pret the messages they receive through the various media and to use these media to com-  
municate their own ideas effectively as well. Skills related to high-tech media such as the  
Internet, film, and television are particularly important because of the power and perva-  
sive influence these media wield in our lives and in society. Becoming conversant with  
these and other media can greatly expand the range of information sources available to  
students, and enhance potential career opportunities in the communication and entertain-  
ment industries.

To develop their media literacy skills, students should have opportunities to view,  
analyse, and discuss a wide variety of media texts and relate them to their own experi-  
ence. They should also have opportunities to use available technologies to create media  
texts of different types (e.g., computer graphics, cartoons, graphic designs and layouts,  
radio plays, short videos, web pages).

5. Teachers should make students aware that images, print materials, music, or video clips used in connection with  
tasks and assignments may be subject to copyright, and the appropriate releases should be obtained prior to use. This  
applies to items downloaded from the Internet as well.



  

This strand focuses on helping students develop the skills required to understand, create,  
and critically interpret media texts. It examines how images (both moving and still),  
sound, and words are used, independently and in combination, to create meaning. It  
explores the use and significance of particular conventions and techniques in the media  
and considers the roles of the viewer and the producer in constructing meaning in media  
texts. Students apply the knowledge and skills gained through analysis of media texts as  
they create their own texts.

In the specific expectations in this strand, the examples and teacher prompts refer to  
media forms and conventions that are appropriate for instruction in the given course.  
These are not, however, the only forms and conventions that students may explore in the  
course, nor are they exclusive to the course. Teachers will continue to use their profes-  
sional judgement to decide on the forms and conventions students will study in every  
course, based on the identified learning needs of the students in their classrooms.

*Optional Courses
----------------*The expectations in the optional courses in the English program are clustered in strands  
suited to the particular theme or focus of the course. 

The Grade 10 optional course, Literacy Skills: Reading and Writing, contains two strands:  
Reading Skills and Writing Skills.

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information  
gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses  
in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also  
serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students   
needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices.

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including  
assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects  
how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of  
assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts  
towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student  
work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and  
the achievement levels outlined in this document.

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they  
lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evalua-  
tion strategies that:

address both what students learn and how well they learn;

are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement  
level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 24 25; 

are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide  
opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 

are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the  
needs and experiences of the students;

AND EVALUATION

are fair to all students; 

accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with  
the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 

accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction  
(English or French);

ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 

promote students ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 

include the use of samples of students work that provide evidence of   
their achievement; 

are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or  
the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses  
on students achievement of the overall expectations. A student s achievement of the  
overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific  
expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations  
define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the over-  
all expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which spe-  
cific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and  
which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observa-  
tion) but not necessarily evaluated.

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 24 25) for level 3 represent the  
 provincial standard for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture  
of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in English can be constructed by reading  
from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed 70 79%  
(Level 3) . Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will  
be prepared for work in subsequent courses.

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still  
reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard.  
Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that  
achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond  
those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or  
almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability  
to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student  
achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR ENGLISH
---------------------------------

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in  
English. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers.  
It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear per-  
formance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to:

provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for   
all courses outlined in this document; 

guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 

help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 

assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students;

provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate   
students learning.

Categories of Knowledge and Skills
----------------------------------

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and  
skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four  
categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and intercon-  
nectedness of learning.

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows:

*Knowledge and Understanding.
----------------------------*

Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowl-

edge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

*Thinking.
---------*

The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:

planning skills (e.g., generating ideas, gathering information, focusing research,  
organizing information)

processing skills (e.g., drawing inferences, interpreting, analysing, synthesizing,  
evaluating)

critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., oral discourse, research, critical analysis,  
critical literacy, metacognition, creative process)

*Communication.
--------------*

The conveying of meaning through various text forms.

*Application.
------------*

The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between

various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced man-  
ner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is  
considered within the appropriate categories.

Criteria
--------

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of  
the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and  
Understanding, the criteria are knowledge of content (e.g., forms of text; strategies used  
when listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing; elements of  
style; literary terminology, concepts, and theories; language conventions) and under-  
standing of content (e.g., concepts; ideas; opinions; relationships among facts, ideas, con-  
cepts, themes) . The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed  
and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for.

Descriptors
-----------

A descriptor indicates the characteristic of the student s performance, with respect to   
a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement  
chart, *effectiveness
-------------*is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication,  
and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task  
will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may  
therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic,  
relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particu-  
lar criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might  
focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication  
category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in  
the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections.  
Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might  
focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an  
explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific  
knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better under-  
stand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated.

Qualifiers
----------

A specific qualifier is used to define each of the four levels of achievement that is,  
*limited
-------*for level 1, *some
----*for level 2, *considerable
------------*for level 3, and a *high degree
-----------*or *thorough
--------*for  
level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of perform-  
ance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student s performance at   
level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: the student  
uses planning skills with *considerable
------------*effectiveness . 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify  
the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, stu-  
dents should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent  
of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowl-  
edge and skills.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means  
of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12. The report card provides a record of the stu-  
dent s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in  
the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade rep-  
resents the quality of the student s overall achievement of the expectations for the course  
and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart  
for the discipline.

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every  
course in which the student s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in  
Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows:

Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout  
the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student s most consistent  
level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should  
be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an  
examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to   
the course content and administered towards the end of the course.

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS
-----------------------------------------

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in  
every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization,  
Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale   
(E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation  
and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students   
achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of  
learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation  
in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades.

MINISTRY RESOURCES
------------------

The Ministry of Education has produced or supported the production of a variety of  
resource documents that teachers may find helpful as they plan programs based on the  
expectations outlined in this curriculum document. Those resources include the following:

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the premise that *all students can be successful languagelearners
-----------------------------------------------*. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality  
instruction. 

Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students strengths and address their  
learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose  
for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for   
individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and  
model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and  
learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practise and  
apply their developing knowledge and skills.

SOME

CONSIDERATIONS FOR

PROGRAM PLANNING 



  

Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills  
and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fair-  
ness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

Motivating students and instilling positive habits of mind, such as a willingness and  
determination to persist, to think and communicate with clarity and precision, to take  
responsible risks, and to question and pose problems, are also integral to high-quality  
language instruction.

Language is best learned through activities that present stimulating ideas, issues, and  
themes that are meaningful to students. Since no single instructional approach can meet  
all the needs of each learner, teachers select classroom activities that are based on an  
assessment of students individual needs, proven learning theory, and best practices. In  
effective English programs, teachers introduce a rich variety of activities that integrate  
expectations from different strands and provide for the explicit teaching of knowledge  
and skills. They also provide frequent opportunities for students to rehearse, practise, and  
apply skills and strategies, and to make their own choices. 

PLANNING ENGLISH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs.  
They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with  
special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. *Special EducationTransformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table onSpecial Education, 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for  
students with special education needs *in all disciplines
------------------*. Those beliefs are as follows:

All students can succeed. 

Universal design and differentiated instruction are effective and interconnected  
means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students.

Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research,   
tempered by experience.

Classroom teachers are key educators for a student s literacy and numeracy   
development.

Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning.

Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning  
environment that supports students with special education needs.

Fairness is not sameness. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and  
needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance  
tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest pos-  
sible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for  
instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs  
that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.

In planning English courses for students with special education needs, teachers should  
begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

English

and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are  
expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the fol-  
lowing options is appropriate for the student: 

no accommodations

6 or modifications; or 

accommodations only; or 

modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or

alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations  
for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the rele-  
vant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or  
her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs  
for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative  
programs and/or courses, can be found in *The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A ResourceGuide, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*). For a detailed discussion  
of the ministry s requirements for IEPs, see *Individual Education Plans: Standards forDevelopment, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as *IEPStandards, 2000
------------------*). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only
--------------------------------------

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course  
curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to  
the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student s learning must be  
identified in his or her IEP (see *IEP Standards, 2000
-------------------*, page 11). A student s IEP is likely to  
reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first  
option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design  
and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the  
diverse needs of learners.

There are three types of accommodations:

*Instructional accommodations
----------------------------*are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of  
presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 

*Environmental accommodations
----------------------------*are changes that the student may require in the class-  
room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 

*Assessment accommodations
-------------------------*are changes in assessment procedures that enable the  
student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to  
complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see  
page 29 of the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*, for more examples). 

If a student requires accommodations only in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expecta-  
tions and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student s  
Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of  
accommodations will be included.

6. Accommodations refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or   
individualized equipment.



  

Students Requiring Modified Expectations
----------------------------------------

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course  
expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular  
course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations.  
Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achieve-  
ments and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate  
independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student s IEP, the extent to which  
expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry s policy docu-  
ment *Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, the  
principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes  
successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to  
receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and  
the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course,  
the modified expectations should identify *how the required knowledge and skills differ fromthose identified in the course expectations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*. When modifications are so extensive that achieve-  
ment of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely  
to result in a credit, the expectations should *specify the precise requirements or tasks on whichthe student s performance will be evaluated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*and which will be used to generate the course  
mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate and have assessed *in each reporting period
------------------------*(*IEP Standards, 2000,
--------------------*pages 10 and 11).  
The student s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student s progress  
at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (*IEP Standards,2000
------------------*, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP  
and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student s learn-  
ing expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for  
the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If,  
however, the student s learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the prin-  
cipal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked  
and the appropriate statement from the *Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12,1999
-----------------------------------------------------*(page 8) must be inserted. The teacher s comments should include relevant informa-  
tion on the student s demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next  
steps for the student s learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
----------------------------------------------------

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The  
first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario s English language  
schools is a language other than English. Ontario s linguistic heritage includes several  
Aboriginal languages; many African, Asian, and European languages; and some varieties  
of English, such as Jamaican Creole. Many English language learners were born in  
Canada and raised in families and communities in which languages other than English

were spoken, or in which the variety of English spoken differed significantly from the  
English of Ontario classrooms. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as new-  
comers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educa-  
tional systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling  
was limited.

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic  
and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for their English lan-  
guage development.

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional  
language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge  
and experience to the classroom. These students linguistic and cultural backgrounds not  
only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in  
the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity  
into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment.

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in  
their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school,  
there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued develop-  
ment of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage  
parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foun-  
dation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers  
to find opportunities to bring students languages into the classroom, using parents and  
community members as a resource.

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive  
support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting  
their language-learning needs:

*English as a Second Language (ESL)
----------------------------------*

programs are for students born in Canada or new-

comers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English  
significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

*English Literacy Development (ELD)
----------------------------------*

programs are primarily for newcomers whose first

language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different  
from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in  
their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education  
is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills  
in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may  
also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from  
ELD instruction.

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teach-  
ers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every  
learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and  
at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language  
acquisition may go through a silent period during which they closely observe the inter-  
actions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use  
body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have

gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and  
responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nur-  
tures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When  
they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some   
students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while  
others will speak quite fluently.

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young  
children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts  
and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in  
English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student s knowledge of vocab-  
ulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language profi-  
ciency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success.  
Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to  
catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic pur-  
poses. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the language  
knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they  
require from their teachers.

Responsibility for students English-language development is shared by the classroom  
teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and  
peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language class-  
room. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of  
these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include:

modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging  
but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given  
the necessary support from the teacher; 

use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic  
organizers, scaffolding; previewing of textbooks, pre-teaching of key vocabulary;  
peer tutoring; strategic use of students first languages); 

use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual   
dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 

use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral inter-  
views, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of  
graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assess-  
ment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner  
(whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must  
be clearly indicated on the student s report card.

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students  
who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adapta-  
tions to be successful.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION Overview
-------------------------------------

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects   
of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to high  
standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of  
identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value  
and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to  
adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence,  
and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves  
and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships,  
and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools also have the opportunity to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the  
diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a  
variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members  
from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays,  
concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with  
the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach  
and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

Antidiscrimination Education in the English Program
---------------------------------------------------

Learning resources that reflect the broad range of students interests, backgrounds, cultures,  
and experiences are an important aspect of an inclusive English program. In such a program,  
learning materials involve protagonists of both sexes from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Teachers routinely use materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world cultures,  
including those of contemporary First Nations, M tis, and Inuit peoples, and make them  
available to students. Short stories, novels, magazine and newspaper articles, television  
programs, and films provide opportunities for students to explore issues relating to their  
self-identity. In inclusive programs, students are made aware of the historical, cultural,  
and political contexts for both the traditional and non-traditional gender and social roles  
represented in the materials they are studying. 

Stories, novels, informational texts, and media works relating to the immigrant experience  
provide rich thematic material for study, as well as the opportunity for students new to  
Canada to share their knowledge and experiences with others. In addition, in the context  
of the English program, both students and teachers should become aware of aspects of  
intercultural communication for example, by exploring how different cultures interpret  
the use of eye contact and body language in conversation and during presentations.

Resources should be chosen not only to reflect diversity but also on the basis of their  
appeal for both girls and boys in the classroom. Recent research has shown that many  
boys are interested in informational materials, such as manuals and graphic texts, as  
opposed to works of fiction, which are often more appealing to girls. Both sexes read  
Internet materials, such as website articles, e-mail, and chat messages, outside the class-  
room. *Me Read? No Way! A Practical Guide to Improving Boys Literacy Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------*(available on the  
Ministry of Education website) provides a number of useful literacy strategies that focus  
on engaging boys in reading and writing and that can enhance the learning environment  
for both female and male students.

The development of critical thinking skills is integral to the English curriculum. In the  
context of what is now called critical literacy , these skills include the ability to identify  
perspectives, values, and issues; detect bias; and read for implicit as well as overt mean-  
ing. In the English program, students develop the ability to detect negative bias and  
stereotypes in literary texts and informational materials. When using biased informa-  
tional texts, or literary works containing negative stereotypes, for the express purpose of  
critical analysis, teachers must take into account the potential negative impact of bias on  
students and use appropriate strategies to address students responses.

Critical literacy also involves asking questions and challenging the status quo, and leads  
students to look at issues of power and justice in society. The program empowers stu-  
dents by enabling them to express themselves and to speak out about issues that strongly  
affect them.

Literature studies and media studies also afford both students and teachers a unique  
opportunity to explore the social and emotional impact of bullying, violence, and discrim-  
ination in the form of racism, sexism, or homophobia on individuals and families.  
Teachers can help students link the understanding they gain in this regard to messages  
conveyed through the school s antibullying and violence-prevention programming.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students success  
in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

The acquisition and development of literacy skills is clearly the focus of the English cur-  
riculum, but the English program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical  
literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams,  
charts, tables, and graphs, and the English curriculum emphasizes students ability to  
interpret and use graphic texts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In English courses, students are  
encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible  
answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to  
locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, diction-  
aries, encyclopaedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised  
in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of informa-  
tion have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a  
responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropri-  
ate ways. The ability to locate, question, and validate information allows a student to  
become an independent, lifelong learner.

THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------

The school library program can help to build and transform students knowledge to support  
lifelong learning in our information- and knowledge-based society. The school library  
program supports student success across the language curriculum by encouraging students  
to read widely, teaching them to read for understanding and enjoyment, and helping them  
to improve their research skills and to use information gathered through research effectively. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

English

34
--



  

The school library program enables students to:

develop a love of reading for learning and for pleasure; 

acquire an understanding of the richness and diversity of literary and informational   
texts produced in Canada and around the world; 

obtain access to programs, resources, and integrated technologies that support   
all curriculum areas; 

understand and value the role of public library systems as a resource for   
lifelong learning.

The school library program plays a key role in the development of information literacy  
and research skills. In collaboration with classroom or content-area teachers, teacher-  
librarians develop, teach, and provide students with authentic information and research  
tasks that foster learning, including the ability to:

locate, select, gather, critically evaluate, create, and communicate information;

use the information obtained to solve problems, make decisions, build knowledge,   
create personal meaning, and enrich their lives; 

communicate their findings for different audiences, using a variety of formats   
and technologies; 

use information and research with understanding, responsibility, and imagination.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can   
significantly extend and enrich teachers instructional strategies and support students   
language learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites,  
digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to  
collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on  
their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect  
students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into  
the local classroom.

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support  
and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in  
groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to museums  
and archives in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and  
projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates.

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its  
use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible  
use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to  
promote hatred.

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-  
class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to  
learning to meet diverse student needs.

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS
------------------------------------------------

Teachers planning programs in English need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of  
the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that  
enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school work  
connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text,  
Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and  
includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how  
workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are  
used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work  
habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service.  
The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students demonstration of  
these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can  
use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill  
development, and show employers what they can do. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada  
and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through  
extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills  
provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their  
jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the  
Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca.

CAREER EDUCATION
----------------

Expectations in the English program include many opportunities for students to apply  
their language skills to work-related situations, to explore educational and career options,  
and to become self-directed learners. To prepare students for the literacy demands of a  
wide array of postsecondary educational programs and careers, English courses require  
students to develop research skills, practise expository writing, and learn strategies for  
understanding informational reading materials. Making oral presentations and working  
in small groups with classmates help students express themselves confidently and work  
cooperatively with others. Regardless of their postsecondary destination, all students need  
to realize that literacy skills are employability skills. Powerful literacy skills will equip  
students to manage information technologies, communicate effectively and correctly in a  
variety of situations, and perform a variety of tasks required in most work environments.

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing,  
field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed  
in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and  
public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to  
broaden students knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields,  
including publishing, advertising, and media-related industries. In addition, students  
develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of  
employer employee relationships. Teachers of English can support their students learning  
by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access  
to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education  
and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace  
learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand  
the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part  
in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed  
for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality  
as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the  
right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be  
aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal  
safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies  
and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for  
Students in Work Education Programs (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring  
the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least  
14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing  
or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the  
minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons  
to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and  
other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry s policy  
document entitled *Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policiesand Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH-SKILLS MAJOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

English courses are well suited for inclusion in programs leading to a Specialist High-  
Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular appren-  
ticeship or workplace destinations. In an SHSM program, English courses can be bundled  
with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular  
industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education,  
including apprenticeship. English courses may also be combined with cooperative educa-  
tion credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for  
various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM pro-  
grams would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers,  
skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
----------------------------------------

Although health and safety issues are not usually associated with language education, they  
may be important when the learning involves fieldwork. Out-of-school fieldwork can  
provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students learning experiences. Teachers  
must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students health and safety.

This document replaces *The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 and 10: English, 1999
------------------------------------------------------*. Beginning in  
September 2007, all English courses for Grades 9 and 10 will be based on the expectations  
outlined in this document.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
----------------------------------------------

The goal of Ontario secondary schools is to support high-quality learning while giving  
individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests.  
The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options  
outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their  
high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY, LANGUAGE, AND THEENGLISH CURRICULUM
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Literacy is about more than reading or writing it is about how we communicate in society. It is about social practices and relationships, about knowledge, language and culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Those who use literacy take it for granted but those who cannot use it are excludedfrom much communication in today s world. Indeed, it is the excluded who can bestappreciate the notion of literacy as freedom .

UNESCO, Statement for the United Nations Literacy Decade, 2003 2012

Literacy development is a communal project, and the teaching of literacy skills is embedded  
across the Ontario curriculum. However, it is the English curriculum that is dedicated to  
developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based that is, knowledge and  
skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing.

Language development is central to students intellectual, social, cultural, and emotional  
growth and must be seen as a key component of the curriculum. When students learn to  
use language, they do more than master the basic skills. They learn to value the power   
of language and to use it responsibly. They learn to express feelings and opinions and to  
support their opinions with sound arguments and evidence from research. They become  
aware of the many purposes for which language is used and the diverse forms it can take  
to serve particular purposes and audiences. They learn to use the formal language appro-  
priate for debates and essays, the narrative language of stories and novels, the figurative  
language of poetry, the technical language of instructions and manuals. They develop   
an awareness of how language is used in different formal and informal situations. They  
come to understand that language is an important medium for communicating ideas and

INTRODUCTION



  

information, expressing world views, and realizing and communicating artistic vision.  
Students learn that language can be not only used as a tool but also appreciated and enjoyed.

Language is the basis for thinking, communicating, learning, and viewing the world.  
Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact  
socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and  
demonstrate their learning. Learning to communicate with clarity and precision will help  
students to thrive in the world beyond school.

Language is a fundamental element of identity and culture. As students read and reflect  
on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,

1 they develop a deeper under-

standing of themselves and others and of the world around them. If they see themselves  
and others in the texts they study, they will be more engaged in learning and they will  
also come to appreciate the nature and value of a diverse, multicultural society. They will  
develop the ability to understand and critically interpret a range of texts and to recognize  
that a text conveys one particular perspective among many.

Language skills are developed across the curriculum and, cumulatively, through the grades.  
Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics,  
themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all  
subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability  
to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students  
develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time.  
As they move through the secondary school program, they are required to use language  
with ever-increasing accuracy and fluency in an expanding range of situations. They are  
also expected to assume responsibility for their own learning and to apply their language  
skills in more challenging and complex ways.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM
--------------------------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible  
and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners.  
The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they  
need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

Successful language learners:

understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;

communicate that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent effectively  
and with confidence;

make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts,  
and the world around them;

think critically;

understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized,  
questioned, assessed, and evaluated;

appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;

use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal  
growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

1. The word *text* is used in this document in its broadest sense, as a means of communication that uses words, graphics,  
sounds, and/or images to convey information and ideas to an audience.



  

The English curriculum takes into account that students in Ontario come from a wide  
variety of backgrounds and that every student has a unique set of perspectives, strengths,  
and needs. Instructional strategies and resources that recognize and reflect the diversity in  
the classroom and that suit individual strengths and needs are therefore critical to student  
success. Reading activities should expose students to materials that reflect the diversity of  
Canadian and world cultures, including those of Aboriginal peoples. Students also need  
to become familiar with the works of recognized writers from their own and earlier eras.  
By reading a wide range of materials and being challenged by what they read, students  
become receptive to new and widely varying ideas and perspectives, and develop their  
ability to think independently and critically.

Research has shown that when students are given opportunities to choose what they   
read and what they write about, they are more likely to discover and pursue their own  
interests. In keeping with this finding, the curriculum requires that students select some  
of the texts they read and decide on the topic, purpose, and audience for some of the  
works they produce.

Research has also shown that effective readers and writers unconsciously apply a range  
of skills and strategies as they read and write. By identifying and explicitly teaching these  
skills and strategies, teachers enable all students to become effective communicators. The  
English curriculum focuses on comprehension strategies for listening, viewing, and reading;  
on the most effective reading and writing processes; on skills and techniques for effective  
oral and written communication and for the creation of effective media texts; and on the  
language conventions needed for clear and coherent communication. In addition, it empha-  
sizes the use of higher-level thinking skills, including critical literacy skills, to enable students  
to understand, appreciate, and evaluate what they read and view at a deeper level, and to  
help them become reflective, critical, and independent learners.

In implementing this curriculum, teachers will help students to see that language skills are  
lifelong learning skills that will enable them to better understand themselves and others,  
unlock their potential as human beings, find fulfilling careers, and become responsible  
world citizens. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENGLISH PROGRAMS Students
-------------------------------------------------------

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make   
the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon  
discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and  
will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will  
find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges  
they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely impor-  
tant to these students success. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and  
learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances.

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with the language curriculum requires work,  
study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue  
opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of the  
communication process. Their understanding and skills will grow as they explore their  
world and engage in activities, for their own purposes, that involve reading, writing,

speaking, listening, viewing, and representing. Students develop their literacy skills when  
they seek out recreational reading materials and multimedia works that relate to their  
personal interests and to other subject areas, and when they engage in conversation with  
parents, peers, and teachers about what they are reading, writing, viewing, representing,  
and thinking in their daily lives.

Parents
-------

Parents

2 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show 

that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education.   
By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in  
the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This  
awareness will enhance parents ability to discuss their children s work with them, to  
communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children s progress.  
Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret  
teachers comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their   
children s learning.

Effective ways in which parents can support their children s learning include attending  
parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops and school council activities  
(including becoming a school council member), and encouraging their children to com-  
plete their assignments at home. 

In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to encourage their  
sons and daughters to take an active interest in using language for meaningful purposes  
as a regular part of their activities outside school. They might encourage them to read  
every day; take out a library membership; join a book club, a computer club, a camera  
club, or a community group; or subscribe to an age-appropriate magazine. They might  
also initiate conversations at home about what their daughters and sons are reading. 

Teachers
--------

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropri-  
ate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well  
as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers bring  
enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing  
different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student.

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide  
numerous opportunities for students to develop the literacy and language skills that will  
allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active  
citizens. The study of literature and the media provides students with an awareness and  
appreciation of the culture that surrounds, challenges, and nourishes them.

Principals
----------

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student  
has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, prin-  
cipals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms  
using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are  
made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects,  
including English, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate  
their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible  
for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving  
the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan in other words,  
for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

The English program in Grades 9 to 12 includes *compulsory courses
------------------*and *optional courses
----------------*.

The compulsory courses emphasize strong core competencies in listening, speaking, reading,  
writing, viewing, and representing. As part of their program in Grades 9 and 10, students  
must take one compulsory course in English in each grade. These courses are offered in  
two types, academic and applied.

3

One optional course is offered in the Grade 9 10 curriculum Literacy Skills: Reading and  
Writing, Grade 10. This course offers students an opportunity to enhance their literacy skills.  
It may be taken to fulfil an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional compul-  
sory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It may also be  
used, at the principal s discretion, as a substitution for one of the compulsory credits required  
in English. The Literacy Skills course is an open course.

Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and  
postsecondary goals. The course types offered in Grades 9 and 10 are defined as follows:

*Academic courses
----------------*

develop students knowledge and skills through the study of theory and

abstract problems. These courses focus on the essential concepts of a subject and explore  
related concepts as well. They incorporate practical applications as appropriate.

*Applied courses
---------------*

focus on the essential concepts of a subject, and develop students knowledge

and skills through practical applications and concrete examples. Familiar situations are  
used to illustrate ideas, and students are given more opportunities to experience hands-on  
applications of the concepts and theories they study.

*Open courses
------------*

are designed to prepare students for further study in the subject, and to

enrich their education generally. These courses comprise a set of expectations that are  
appropriate for all students.

School boards may offer a locally developed compulsory credit (LDCC) course in English  
in each of Grades 9 and 10, which may be used to meet the compulsory credit requirement  
in English for these grades.

4 The Grade 9 and 10 LDCC courses prepare students for suc-

cess in the Grade 11 English workplace preparation course.

THE PROGRAM 

IN ENGLISH

3. If the principal deems that the academic and applied courses in either Grade 9 or Grade 10 are sufficiently different,  
a student may take both courses and, on successful completion, earn a credit for each.   
4. If a student successfully completes both an LDCC course in Grade 9 or Grade 10 English and a curriculum course in English  
in the same grade, the principal may grant a credit for each course, bearing in mind that only one compulsory English credit is  
required in each grade. (The second credit can be used to meet an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional com-  
pulsory credit requirement.)

Half-Credit Courses
-------------------

The courses outlined in the Grade 9 12 English curriculum documents are designed   
as full-credit courses. However*, with the exception of Grade 12 university preparation and university/college preparation courses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses.

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instruction-  
al time, must adhere to the following conditions:

The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the  
expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be  
drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best  
enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time.

A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may  
be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both  
parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete  
both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.)

The title of each half-credit course must include the designation *Part 1
------*or *Part 2
------*. A  
half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card  
and the Ontario Student Transcript.

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described  
above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School  
October Report.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS
-----------------------

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that stu-  
dents are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in vari-  
ous other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand (or broad curriculum area) of every  
course overall expectations and specific expectations. The *overall expectations
--------------------*describe in  
general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the  
end of each course. The *specific expectations
---------------------*describe the expected knowledge and skills in  
greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered headings, or sub-  
organizers , each of which indicates the overall expectation to which the group of specific  
expectations corresponds. Each expectation in a group is identified by an expectation  
tag (a subheading) that describes the particular aspect of the overall expectation to  
which the specific expectation refers (see the illustration on page 13). 

Taken together, the overall and specific expectations represent the mandated curriculum.

In the core English curriculum (the compulsory courses offered in every grade), the *over-all expectations
---------------------*outline standard sets of knowledge and skills required for effective listen-  
ing and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. They encompass the  
types of understanding, skills, approaches, and processes that are applied by effective  
communicators of all ages and levels of development, and are therefore described in con-  
stant terms from grade to grade. The English curriculum focuses on developing the depth

and level of sophistication of students knowledge and skills associated with each of these  
key overall expectations by increasing the complexity of the texts they work with and the  
tasks they perform over time.

The *specific expectations
---------------------*reflect this progression in knowledge and skills from grade to  
grade, and also indicate differences between course types, through a combination of the  
following: (1) the wording of the expectation itself, (2) the examples that are given in  
parentheses in the expectation, and/or (3) the teacher prompts that may follow the expec-  
tation. The examples and teacher prompts help to clarify the requirements specified in the  
expectations and suggest the intended depth and level of complexity of the expectations.  
They have been developed to model appropriate practice for the particular grade and  
course type and are meant to serve as illustrations for teachers. Teachers can choose to  
use the examples and teacher prompts that are appropriate for their classrooms, or they  
may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the  
specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in  
the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the  
student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM*Compulsory Courses*
-----------------------------------------------------

The expectations in the compulsory courses of the English curriculum are organized in  
four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature  
Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. The program in all grades is designed to develop a  
range of essential skills in these four interrelated areas, built on a solid foundation of  
knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical,  
critical, and metacognitive thinking skills. Students learn best when they are encouraged  
to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations  
that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the  
four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to,  
create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in  
the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that  
blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of  
experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy  
skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

Oral Communication
------------------

Oral language is a fundamental means of communication with others and the cornerstone  
of learning in all areas. Through talk, students not only communicate information but  
also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems;  
organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings,  
and opinions. When they converse about information and ideas, they become aware not  
only of the various perspectives of other speakers and writers but also of the language  
structures and conventions they use. As students work towards achieving the expecta-  
tions for this strand, they will improve their ability to explore and communicate ideas in  
both classroom and formal speaking situations. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

English

--



  

To develop their oral communication skills, students need numerous opportunities to listen  
and to talk about a range of subjects, including personal interests, cultural knowledge,  
school work, and current affairs. The language program should provide opportunities   
for students to engage in various thought-provoking oral activities in connection with  
expectations in all the strands for example, brainstorming to identify what they know  
about the topic of a new text they are about to read, discussing strategies for solving a  
problem in a writing assignment, presenting and defending ideas or debating issues, and  
offering informal critiques of work produced by their peers. 

Listening and speaking are essential skills for social interaction at home, at school, and   
in the community. In order for all students to benefit from the opportunities provided in the  
classroom for listening and speaking, differences in the norms and conventions associated  
with oral communication in different cultures must be taken into account. In addition,   
for some students, the notion that learning involves talk is unfamiliar, and talk that sup-  
ports learning must be explicitly taught and modelled. All students can benefit from oppor-  
tunities to improve their listening and response skills and to refine their ideas and their  
ability to express them. The Oral Communication strand focuses on the identification and  
development of the skills and strategies effective listeners and speakers use to understand  
and interact with others. It also emphasizes the use of higher-order thinking skills to   
stimulate students interest and engage them in their own learning.

Reading and Literature Studies
------------------------------

Although many students entering the Grade 9 English program are fluent, independent  
readers, some may need additional support to develop their reading skills and to monitor  
their own progress. In addition, all students need instruction to cope with the more chal-  
lenging reading demands of the secondary school curriculum, which requires students to  
consider increasingly abstract concepts and to use language structures that are more com-  
plex and vocabulary that is more specialized than in earlier grades. The English program  
will help students learn to read efficiently and to absorb information quickly. 

The English curriculum focuses on developing the knowledge and skills that will enable  
students to become effective readers. An effective reader is one who not only grasps the  
ideas communicated in a text but is able to apply them in new contexts. To do this, the  
reader must be able to think clearly, creatively, and critically about the ideas and informa-  
tion encountered in texts in order to understand, analyse, and absorb them and to recog-  
nize their relevance in other contexts. Students can develop the skills necessary to become  
effective readers by applying a range of comprehension strategies as they read and by  
reading a wide variety of texts. It is also important that they read a range of materials that  
illustrate the many uses of writing. By reading widely, students will develop a richer  
vocabulary and become more attuned to the conventions of written language. Reading  
various kinds of texts in all areas of the curriculum will also help students to discover  
what interests them most and to pursue and develop their interests and abilities.

Reading is a complex process that involves the application of various strategies before,  
during, and after reading. For example, before reading, students might prepare by identi-  
fying the purpose of the reading activity and by activating their prior knowledge about  
the topic of the text. Teachers help build the necessary background knowledge for stu-  
dents whose life experiences may not have provided them with the information they  
need to understand the text. During reading, students may use cueing systems that is,

clues from context or from their understanding of language structures and/or letter-sound  
relationships to help them solve unfamiliar words, and comprehension strategies to help  
them make meaning of the text. Comprehension strategies include predicting, visualizing,  
questioning, drawing inferences, identifying main ideas, summarizing, and monitoring  
and revising comprehension. After reading, students may analyse, synthesize, make con-  
nections, evaluate, and use other critical and creative thinking skills to achieve a deeper  
understanding of the material they have read. It is important to note that although the  
specific expectations for each grade may focus on particular strategies that emphasize  
grade-appropriate skills, they do not impose a restriction on the range of strategies students  
will apply in that grade. Teachers must use their professional judgement in deciding which  
comprehension strategies to model and teach, based on the identified learning needs of  
the students in their classrooms and on the nature of the particular texts students are reading.

Fluent, independent readers read frequently for a variety of different purposes to locate  
information, to satisfy curiosity, for enjoyment, to build vocabulary, for research, and for  
various more specifically defined purposes. The purpose for reading will be determined  
by the teacher in some cases and by the student in others. The reading program should  
include a wide variety of literary, informational, and graphic texts that engage students   
interest and imagination for example, novels; poetry; myths, fables, and folk tales; short  
stories; textbooks and books on topics in science, history, mathematics, geography, and  
other subjects; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and journals; plays and radio, film,  
or television scripts; encyclopaedia entries; graphs, charts, and diagrams in textbooks or  
magazine articles; instructions and manuals; graphic novels, comic books, and cartoons;  
newspaper articles and editorials; databases and websites; and essays and reports.  
Teachers routinely provide materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world   
cultures, including the cultures of Aboriginal peoples. Within each course and from one  
grade to another, students should be assigned texts of increasing complexity as they  
develop their reading skills, and should also have many opportunities to select their   
own reading materials. Frequent exposure to good writing will inspire students to work  
towards high standards in their own writing and will help them develop an appreciation  
for the power and beauty of the written word.

The study of literature is central in the secondary English curriculum; it offers students  
opportunities to expand their intellectual horizons and to extend and strengthen their lit-  
eracy skills. As a creative representation of life and experience, literature raises important  
questions about the human condition, now and in the past. As students increase their  
knowledge of accomplished writers and literary works, and vicariously experience times,  
events, cultures, and values different from their own, they deepen their understanding of  
the many dimensions of human thought and human experience. 

All students, regardless of their postsecondary plans, need to read a balance of exemplary  
literary, informational, and graphic texts that nourish the imagination, promote intellectu-  
al growth, contribute to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, and provide a broad range of  
language models for their own writing. They should be exposed to literary works drawn  
from many genres, historical periods, and cultures, by both female and male writers, that  
represent a wide range of perspectives and reflect the diversity of Canada and the world.

This strand helps students learn to read with understanding, to read critically, to become  
familiar with various text forms and their characteristic elements, and to recognize the  
function and effects of various text features and stylistic devices. It helps students

understand that reading is a process of constructing meaning and equips them with the  
strategies that good readers use to understand and appreciate what they read.

Writing
-------

*Writing provides students with powerful opportunities to learn about themselves andtheir connections to the world. Through writing, students organize their thoughts, rememberimportant information, solve problems, reflect on a widening range of perspectives, andlearn how to communicate effectively for specific purposes and audiences. They findtheir voice and have opportunities to explore other voices. By putting their thoughtsinto words and supporting the words with visual images in a range of media, studentsacquire knowledge and deepen their understanding of the content in all school subjects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Ministry of Education, *Literacy for Learning, 2004*, p. 79

A central goal of the Writing strand is to promote students growth as confident writers and  
researchers who can communicate competently using a range of forms and styles to suit  
specific purposes and audiences and correctly applying the conventions of language   
grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. These conventions are best learned in the  
context of meaningful and creative writing activities that allow students to develop the  
ability to think and write clearly and effectively.

Writing, from initial musings to final publication, is a complex process that involves a  
range of complementary thinking and composing skills, as well as other language  
processes, including reading, speaking, and listening. As writers compose, they consider  
their audience; make decisions about form, style, and organization; and apply their  
knowledge of language use. To develop these competencies, students need a supportive  
classroom environment, with opportunities to extend and refine their skills in using the  
writing process and doing research. At the secondary level, teachers continue to teach  
and model effective strategies and skills, as well as provide appropriate scaffolding for  
students who are building skills and working towards independence. Students need  
opportunities to apply these skills and to write daily, in many forms and genres, for a  
variety of purposes and audiences, and within different time constraints. The forms and  
genres explored may include essays, reports, short stories, poetry, scripts, journals, letters,  
biographies, children s stories, articles, reviews, pr cis, explanations, instructions, notes,  
procedures, r sum s, and advertisements. Because postsecondary institutions and  
employers require clear, well-organized writing, on demand and within strict timelines,  
students also need to learn and practise strategies for writing effectively and correctly in  
the context of in-class writing assignments and test situations.

Students benefit from opportunities to produce writing that is interesting and original and  
that reflects their capacity for independent critical thought. Writing activities that students  
find meaningful and that challenge them to think creatively about topics and concerns that  
interest them will lead to a fuller and more lasting command of the essential skills of writing. 

The overall expectations in this strand focus on the elements of effective writing  
(ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, language conventions,  
and presentation) and on the stages of the recursive writing process (planning for writing,  
drafting, revising, editing and proofreading, and publishing). In the specific expectations,  
the examples and teacher prompts refer to writing forms and language conventions that  
are appropriate for instruction in the given course. The forms and conventions noted are  
not, however, the only ones that may be taught in the course, nor are they exclusive to the

course. Teachers will continue to make professional decisions about which writing forms  
and language conventions they will cover in every course, based on the identified learning  
needs of the students in their classrooms. 

Media Studies
-------------

Media Studies focuses on the art, meaning, and messaging of various forms of media texts.  
Media texts can be understood to include any work, object, or event that communicates  
meaning to an audience. Most media texts use words, graphics, sounds, and/or images, in  
print, oral, visual, or electronic form, to communicate information and ideas to their audi-  
ence. Whereas traditional English language study may be seen to focus primarily on the  
understanding of the word, media studies focuses on the construction of meaning through  
the combination of several media languages images, sounds, graphics, and words.

Media Studies explores the impact and influence of mass media and popular culture by  
examining texts such as films, songs, video games, action figures, advertisements, CD  
covers, clothing, billboards, television shows, magazines, newspapers, photographs, and  
websites.

5 These texts abound in our electronic information age, and the messages they

convey, both overt and implied, can have a significant influence on students lives. For  
this reason, critical thinking as it applies to media products and messages assumes a   
special significance. Understanding how media texts are constructed and why they are  
produced enables students to respond to them intelligently and responsibly. Students  
must be able to differentiate between fact and opinion; evaluate the credibility of sources;  
recognize bias; be attuned to discriminatory portrayals of individuals and groups, such as  
religious or sexual minorities, people with disabilities, or seniors; and question depictions  
of violence and crime.

Students repertoire of communication skills should include the ability to critically inter-  
pret the messages they receive through the various media and to use these media to com-  
municate their own ideas effectively as well. Skills related to high-tech media such as the  
Internet, film, and television are particularly important because of the power and perva-  
sive influence these media wield in our lives and in society. Becoming conversant with  
these and other media can greatly expand the range of information sources available to  
students, and enhance potential career opportunities in the communication and entertain-  
ment industries.

To develop their media literacy skills, students should have opportunities to view,  
analyse, and discuss a wide variety of media texts and relate them to their own experi-  
ence. They should also have opportunities to use available technologies to create media  
texts of different types (e.g., computer graphics, cartoons, graphic designs and layouts,  
radio plays, short videos, web pages).

5. Teachers should make students aware that images, print materials, music, or video clips used in connection with  
tasks and assignments may be subject to copyright, and the appropriate releases should be obtained prior to use. This  
applies to items downloaded from the Internet as well.



  

This strand focuses on helping students develop the skills required to understand, create,  
and critically interpret media texts. It examines how images (both moving and still),  
sound, and words are used, independently and in combination, to create meaning. It  
explores the use and significance of particular conventions and techniques in the media  
and considers the roles of the viewer and the producer in constructing meaning in media  
texts. Students apply the knowledge and skills gained through analysis of media texts as  
they create their own texts.

In the specific expectations in this strand, the examples and teacher prompts refer to  
media forms and conventions that are appropriate for instruction in the given course.  
These are not, however, the only forms and conventions that students may explore in the  
course, nor are they exclusive to the course. Teachers will continue to use their profes-  
sional judgement to decide on the forms and conventions students will study in every  
course, based on the identified learning needs of the students in their classrooms.

*Optional Courses
----------------*The expectations in the optional courses in the English program are clustered in strands  
suited to the particular theme or focus of the course. 

The Grade 10 optional course, Literacy Skills: Reading and Writing, contains two strands:  
Reading Skills and Writing Skills.

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information  
gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses  
in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also  
serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students   
needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices.

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including  
assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects  
how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of  
assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts  
towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student  
work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and  
the achievement levels outlined in this document.

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they  
lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evalua-  
tion strategies that:

address both what students learn and how well they learn;

are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement  
level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 24 25; 

are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide  
opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 

are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the  
needs and experiences of the students;

AND EVALUATION

are fair to all students; 

accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with  
the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 

accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction  
(English or French);

ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 

promote students ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 

include the use of samples of students work that provide evidence of   
their achievement; 

are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or  
the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses  
on students achievement of the overall expectations. A student s achievement of the  
overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific  
expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations  
define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the over-  
all expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which spe-  
cific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and  
which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observa-  
tion) but not necessarily evaluated.

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 24 25) for level 3 represent the  
 provincial standard for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture  
of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in English can be constructed by reading  
from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed 70 79%  
(Level 3) . Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will  
be prepared for work in subsequent courses.

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still  
reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard.  
Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that  
achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond  
those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or  
almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability  
to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student  
achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR ENGLISH
---------------------------------

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in  
English. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers.  
It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear per-  
formance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to:

provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for   
all courses outlined in this document; 

guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 

help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 

assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students;

provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate   
students learning.

Categories of Knowledge and Skills
----------------------------------

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and  
skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four  
categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and intercon-  
nectedness of learning.

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows:

*Knowledge and Understanding.
----------------------------*

Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowl-

edge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

*Thinking.
---------*

The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:

planning skills (e.g., generating ideas, gathering information, focusing research,  
organizing information)

processing skills (e.g., drawing inferences, interpreting, analysing, synthesizing,  
evaluating)

critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., oral discourse, research, critical analysis,  
critical literacy, metacognition, creative process)

*Communication.
--------------*

The conveying of meaning through various text forms.

*Application.
------------*

The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between

various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced man-  
ner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is  
considered within the appropriate categories.

Criteria
--------

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of  
the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and  
Understanding, the criteria are knowledge of content (e.g., forms of text; strategies used  
when listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing; elements of  
style; literary terminology, concepts, and theories; language conventions) and under-  
standing of content (e.g., concepts; ideas; opinions; relationships among facts, ideas, con-  
cepts, themes) . The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed  
and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for.

Descriptors
-----------

A descriptor indicates the characteristic of the student s performance, with respect to   
a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement  
chart, *effectiveness
-------------*is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication,  
and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task  
will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may  
therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic,  
relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particu-  
lar criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might  
focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication  
category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in  
the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections.  
Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might  
focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an  
explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific  
knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better under-  
stand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated.

Qualifiers
----------

A specific qualifier is used to define each of the four levels of achievement that is,  
*limited
-------*for level 1, *some
----*for level 2, *considerable
------------*for level 3, and a *high degree
-----------*or *thorough
--------*for  
level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of perform-  
ance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student s performance at   
level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: the student  
uses planning skills with *considerable
------------*effectiveness . 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify  
the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, stu-  
dents should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent  
of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowl-  
edge and skills.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means  
of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12. The report card provides a record of the stu-  
dent s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in  
the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade rep-  
resents the quality of the student s overall achievement of the expectations for the course  
and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart  
for the discipline.

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every  
course in which the student s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in  
Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows:

Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout  
the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student s most consistent  
level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should  
be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an  
examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to   
the course content and administered towards the end of the course.

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS
-----------------------------------------

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in  
every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization,  
Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale   
(E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation  
and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students   
achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of  
learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation  
in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades.

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the premise that *all students can be successful languagelearners
-----------------------------------------------*. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality  
instruction. 

Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students strengths and address their  
learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose  
for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for   
individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and  
model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and  
learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practise and  
apply their developing knowledge and skills.

SOME

CONSIDERATIONS FOR

PROGRAM PLANNING 



  

Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills  
and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fair-  
ness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

Motivating students and instilling positive habits of mind, such as a willingness and  
determination to persist, to think and communicate with clarity and precision, to take  
responsible risks, and to question and pose problems, are also integral to high-quality  
language instruction.

Language is best learned through activities that present stimulating ideas, issues, and  
themes that are meaningful to students. Since no single instructional approach can meet  
all the needs of each learner, teachers select classroom activities that are based on an  
assessment of students individual needs, proven learning theory, and best practices. In  
effective English programs, teachers introduce a rich variety of activities that integrate  
expectations from different strands and provide for the explicit teaching of knowledge  
and skills. They also provide frequent opportunities for students to rehearse, practise, and  
apply skills and strategies, and to make their own choices. 

PLANNING ENGLISH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs.  
They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with  
special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. *Special EducationTransformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table onSpecial Education, 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for  
students with special education needs *in all disciplines
------------------*. Those beliefs are as follows:

All students can succeed. 

Universal design and differentiated instruction are effective and interconnected  
means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students.

Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research,   
tempered by experience.

Classroom teachers are key educators for a student s literacy and numeracy   
development.

Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning.

Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning  
environment that supports students with special education needs.

Fairness is not sameness. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and  
needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance  
tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest pos-  
sible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for  
instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs  
that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.

In planning English courses for students with special education needs, teachers should  
begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

English

and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are  
expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the fol-  
lowing options is appropriate for the student: 

no accommodations

6 or modifications; or 

accommodations only; or 

modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or

alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations  
for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the rele-  
vant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or  
her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs  
for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative  
programs and/or courses, can be found in *The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A ResourceGuide, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*). For a detailed discussion  
of the ministry s requirements for IEPs, see *Individual Education Plans: Standards forDevelopment, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as *IEPStandards, 2000
------------------*). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only
--------------------------------------

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course  
curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to  
the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student s learning must be  
identified in his or her IEP (see *IEP Standards, 2000
-------------------*, page 11). A student s IEP is likely to  
reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first  
option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design  
and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the  
diverse needs of learners.

There are three types of accommodations:

*Instructional accommodations
----------------------------*are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of  
presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 

*Environmental accommodations
----------------------------*are changes that the student may require in the class-  
room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 

*Assessment accommodations
-------------------------*are changes in assessment procedures that enable the  
student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to  
complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see  
page 29 of the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*, for more examples). 

If a student requires accommodations only in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expecta-  
tions and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student s  
Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of  
accommodations will be included.

6. Accommodations refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or   
individualized equipment.



  

Students Requiring Modified Expectations
----------------------------------------

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course  
expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular  
course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations.  
Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achieve-  
ments and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate  
independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student s IEP, the extent to which  
expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry s policy docu-  
ment *Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, the  
principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes  
successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to  
receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and  
the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course,  
the modified expectations should identify *how the required knowledge and skills differ fromthose identified in the course expectations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*. When modifications are so extensive that achieve-  
ment of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely  
to result in a credit, the expectations should *specify the precise requirements or tasks on whichthe student s performance will be evaluated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*and which will be used to generate the course  
mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate and have assessed *in each reporting period
------------------------*(*IEP Standards, 2000,
--------------------*pages 10 and 11).  
The student s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student s progress  
at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (*IEP Standards,2000
------------------*, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP  
and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student s learn-  
ing expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for  
the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If,  
however, the student s learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the prin-  
cipal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked  
and the appropriate statement from the *Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12,1999
-----------------------------------------------------*(page 8) must be inserted. The teacher s comments should include relevant informa-  
tion on the student s demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next  
steps for the student s learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
----------------------------------------------------

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The  
first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario s English language  
schools is a language other than English. Ontario s linguistic heritage includes several  
Aboriginal languages; many African, Asian, and European languages; and some varieties  
of English, such as Jamaican Creole. Many English language learners were born in  
Canada and raised in families and communities in which languages other than English

were spoken, or in which the variety of English spoken differed significantly from the  
English of Ontario classrooms. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as new-  
comers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educa-  
tional systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling  
was limited.

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic  
and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for their English lan-  
guage development.

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional  
language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge  
and experience to the classroom. These students linguistic and cultural backgrounds not  
only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in  
the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity  
into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment.

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in  
their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school,  
there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued develop-  
ment of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage  
parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foun-  
dation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers  
to find opportunities to bring students languages into the classroom, using parents and  
community members as a resource.

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive  
support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting  
their language-learning needs:

*English as a Second Language (ESL)
----------------------------------*

programs are for students born in Canada or new-

comers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English  
significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

*English Literacy Development (ELD)
----------------------------------*

programs are primarily for newcomers whose first

language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different  
from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in  
their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education  
is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills  
in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may  
also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from  
ELD instruction.

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teach-  
ers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every  
learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and  
at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language  
acquisition may go through a silent period during which they closely observe the inter-  
actions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use  
body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have

gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and  
responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nur-  
tures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When  
they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some   
students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while  
others will speak quite fluently.

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young  
children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts  
and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in  
English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student s knowledge of vocab-  
ulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language profi-  
ciency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success.  
Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to  
catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic pur-  
poses. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the language  
knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they  
require from their teachers.

Responsibility for students English-language development is shared by the classroom  
teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and  
peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language class-  
room. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of  
these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include:

modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging  
but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given  
the necessary support from the teacher; 

use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic  
organizers, scaffolding; previewing of textbooks, pre-teaching of key vocabulary;  
peer tutoring; strategic use of students first languages); 

use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual   
dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 

use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral inter-  
views, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of  
graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assess-  
ment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner  
(whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must  
be clearly indicated on the student s report card.

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students  
who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adapta-  
tions to be successful.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION Overview
-------------------------------------

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects   
of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to high  
standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of  
identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value  
and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to  
adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence,  
and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves  
and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships,  
and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools also have the opportunity to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the  
diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a  
variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members  
from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays,  
concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with  
the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach  
and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

Antidiscrimination Education in the English Program
---------------------------------------------------

Learning resources that reflect the broad range of students interests, backgrounds, cultures,  
and experiences are an important aspect of an inclusive English program. In such a program,  
learning materials involve protagonists of both sexes from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Teachers routinely use materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world cultures,  
including those of contemporary First Nations, M tis, and Inuit peoples, and make them  
available to students. Short stories, novels, magazine and newspaper articles, television  
programs, and films provide opportunities for students to explore issues relating to their  
self-identity. In inclusive programs, students are made aware of the historical, cultural,  
and political contexts for both the traditional and non-traditional gender and social roles  
represented in the materials they are studying. 

Stories, novels, informational texts, and media works relating to the immigrant experience  
provide rich thematic material for study, as well as the opportunity for students new to  
Canada to share their knowledge and experiences with others. In addition, in the context  
of the English program, both students and teachers should become aware of aspects of  
intercultural communication for example, by exploring how different cultures interpret  
the use of eye contact and body language in conversation and during presentations.

Resources should be chosen not only to reflect diversity but also on the basis of their  
appeal for both girls and boys in the classroom. Recent research has shown that many  
boys are interested in informational materials, such as manuals and graphic texts, as  
opposed to works of fiction, which are often more appealing to girls. Both sexes read  
Internet materials, such as website articles, e-mail, and chat messages, outside the class-  
room. *Me Read? No Way! A Practical Guide to Improving Boys Literacy Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------*(available on the  
Ministry of Education website) provides a number of useful literacy strategies that focus  
on engaging boys in reading and writing and that can enhance the learning environment  
for both female and male students.

The development of critical thinking skills is integral to the English curriculum. In the  
context of what is now called critical literacy , these skills include the ability to identify  
perspectives, values, and issues; detect bias; and read for implicit as well as overt mean-  
ing. In the English program, students develop the ability to detect negative bias and  
stereotypes in literary texts and informational materials. When using biased informa-  
tional texts, or literary works containing negative stereotypes, for the express purpose of  
critical analysis, teachers must take into account the potential negative impact of bias on  
students and use appropriate strategies to address students responses.

Critical literacy also involves asking questions and challenging the status quo, and leads  
students to look at issues of power and justice in society. The program empowers stu-  
dents by enabling them to express themselves and to speak out about issues that strongly  
affect them.

Literature studies and media studies also afford both students and teachers a unique  
opportunity to explore the social and emotional impact of bullying, violence, and discrim-  
ination in the form of racism, sexism, or homophobia on individuals and families.  
Teachers can help students link the understanding they gain in this regard to messages  
conveyed through the school s antibullying and violence-prevention programming.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students success  
in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

The acquisition and development of literacy skills is clearly the focus of the English cur-  
riculum, but the English program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical  
literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams,  
charts, tables, and graphs, and the English curriculum emphasizes students ability to  
interpret and use graphic texts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In English courses, students are  
encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible  
answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to  
locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, diction-  
aries, encyclopaedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised  
in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of informa-  
tion have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a  
responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropri-  
ate ways. The ability to locate, question, and validate information allows a student to  
become an independent, lifelong learner.

THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------

The school library program can help to build and transform students knowledge to support  
lifelong learning in our information- and knowledge-based society. The school library  
program supports student success across the language curriculum by encouraging students  
to read widely, teaching them to read for understanding and enjoyment, and helping them  
to improve their research skills and to use information gathered through research effectively. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

The school library program enables students to:

develop a love of reading for learning and for pleasure; 

acquire an understanding of the richness and diversity of literary and informational   
texts produced in Canada and around the world; 

obtain access to programs, resources, and integrated technologies that support   
all curriculum areas; 

understand and value the role of public library systems as a resource for   
lifelong learning.

The school library program plays a key role in the development of information literacy  
and research skills. In collaboration with classroom or content-area teachers, teacher-  
librarians develop, teach, and provide students with authentic information and research  
tasks that foster learning, including the ability to:

locate, select, gather, critically evaluate, create, and communicate information;

use the information obtained to solve problems, make decisions, build knowledge,   
create personal meaning, and enrich their lives; 

communicate their findings for different audiences, using a variety of formats   
and technologies; 

use information and research with understanding, responsibility, and imagination.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can   
significantly extend and enrich teachers instructional strategies and support students   
language learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites,  
digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to  
collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on  
their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect  
students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into  
the local classroom.

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support  
and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in  
groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to museums  
and archives in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and  
projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates.

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its  
use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible  
use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to  
promote hatred.

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-  
class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to  
learning to meet diverse student needs.

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS
------------------------------------------------

Teachers planning programs in English need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of  
the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that  
enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school work  
connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text,  
Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and  
includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how  
workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are  
used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work  
habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service.  
The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students demonstration of  
these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can  
use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill  
development, and show employers what they can do. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada  
and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through  
extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills  
provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their  
jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the  
Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca.

CAREER EDUCATION
----------------

Expectations in the English program include many opportunities for students to apply  
their language skills to work-related situations, to explore educational and career options,  
and to become self-directed learners. To prepare students for the literacy demands of a  
wide array of postsecondary educational programs and careers, English courses require  
students to develop research skills, practise expository writing, and learn strategies for  
understanding informational reading materials. Making oral presentations and working  
in small groups with classmates help students express themselves confidently and work  
cooperatively with others. Regardless of their postsecondary destination, all students need  
to realize that literacy skills are employability skills. Powerful literacy skills will equip  
students to manage information technologies, communicate effectively and correctly in a  
variety of situations, and perform a variety of tasks required in most work environments.

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing,  
field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed  
in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and  
public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to  
broaden students knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields,  
including publishing, advertising, and media-related industries. In addition, students  
develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of  
employer employee relationships. Teachers of English can support their students learning  
by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access  
to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education  
and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace  
learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand  
the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part  
in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed  
for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality  
as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the  
right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be  
aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal  
safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies  
and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for  
Students in Work Education Programs (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring  
the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least  
14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing  
or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the  
minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons  
to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and  
other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry s policy  
document entitled *Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policiesand Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH-SKILLS MAJOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

English courses are well suited for inclusion in programs leading to a Specialist High-  
Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular appren-  
ticeship or workplace destinations. In an SHSM program, English courses can be bundled  
with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular  
industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education,  
including apprenticeship. English courses may also be combined with cooperative educa-  
tion credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for  
various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM pro-  
grams would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers,  
skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
----------------------------------------

Although health and safety issues are not usually associated with language education, they  
may be important when the learning involves fieldwork. Out-of-school fieldwork can  
provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students learning experiences. Teachers  
must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students health and safety.

This document replaces *The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 and 10: English, 1999
------------------------------------------------------*. Beginning in  
September 2007, all English courses for Grades 9 and 10 will be based on the expectations  
outlined in this document.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
----------------------------------------------

The goal of Ontario secondary schools is to support high-quality learning while giving  
individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests.  
The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options  
outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their  
high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY, LANGUAGE, AND THEENGLISH CURRICULUM
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Literacy is about more than reading or writing it is about how we communicate in society. It is about social practices and relationships, about knowledge, language and culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Those who use literacy take it for granted but those who cannot use it are excludedfrom much communication in today s world. Indeed, it is the excluded who can bestappreciate the notion of literacy as freedom .

UNESCO, Statement for the United Nations Literacy Decade, 2003 2012

Literacy development is a communal project, and the teaching of literacy skills is embedded  
across the Ontario curriculum. However, it is the English curriculum that is dedicated to  
developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based that is, knowledge and  
skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing.

Language development is central to students intellectual, social, cultural, and emotional  
growth and must be seen as a key component of the curriculum. When students learn to  
use language, they do more than master the basic skills. They learn to value the power   
of language and to use it responsibly. They learn to express feelings and opinions and to  
support their opinions with sound arguments and evidence from research. They become  
aware of the many purposes for which language is used and the diverse forms it can take  
to serve particular purposes and audiences. They learn to use the formal language appro-  
priate for debates and essays, the narrative language of stories and novels, the figurative  
language of poetry, the technical language of instructions and manuals. They develop   
an awareness of how language is used in different formal and informal situations. They  
come to understand that language is an important medium for communicating ideas and

INTRODUCTION



  

information, expressing world views, and realizing and communicating artistic vision.  
Students learn that language can be not only used as a tool but also appreciated and enjoyed.

Language is the basis for thinking, communicating, learning, and viewing the world.  
Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact  
socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and  
demonstrate their learning. Learning to communicate with clarity and precision will help  
students to thrive in the world beyond school.

Language is a fundamental element of identity and culture. As students read and reflect  
on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,

1 they develop a deeper under-

standing of themselves and others and of the world around them. If they see themselves  
and others in the texts they study, they will be more engaged in learning and they will  
also come to appreciate the nature and value of a diverse, multicultural society. They will  
develop the ability to understand and critically interpret a range of texts and to recognize  
that a text conveys one particular perspective among many.

Language skills are developed across the curriculum and, cumulatively, through the grades.  
Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics,  
themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all  
subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability  
to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students  
develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time.  
As they move through the secondary school program, they are required to use language  
with ever-increasing accuracy and fluency in an expanding range of situations. They are  
also expected to assume responsibility for their own learning and to apply their language  
skills in more challenging and complex ways.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM
--------------------------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible  
and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners.  
The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they  
need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

Successful language learners:

understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;

communicate that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent effectively  
and with confidence;

make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts,  
and the world around them;

think critically;

understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized,  
questioned, assessed, and evaluated;

appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;

use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal  
growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

1. The word *text* is used in this document in its broadest sense, as a means of communication that uses words, graphics,  
sounds, and/or images to convey information and ideas to an audience.



  

The English curriculum takes into account that students in Ontario come from a wide  
variety of backgrounds and that every student has a unique set of perspectives, strengths,  
and needs. Instructional strategies and resources that recognize and reflect the diversity in  
the classroom and that suit individual strengths and needs are therefore critical to student  
success. Reading activities should expose students to materials that reflect the diversity of  
Canadian and world cultures, including those of Aboriginal peoples. Students also need  
to become familiar with the works of recognized writers from their own and earlier eras.  
By reading a wide range of materials and being challenged by what they read, students  
become receptive to new and widely varying ideas and perspectives, and develop their  
ability to think independently and critically.

Research has shown that when students are given opportunities to choose what they   
read and what they write about, they are more likely to discover and pursue their own  
interests. In keeping with this finding, the curriculum requires that students select some  
of the texts they read and decide on the topic, purpose, and audience for some of the  
works they produce.

Research has also shown that effective readers and writers unconsciously apply a range  
of skills and strategies as they read and write. By identifying and explicitly teaching these  
skills and strategies, teachers enable all students to become effective communicators. The  
English curriculum focuses on comprehension strategies for listening, viewing, and reading;  
on the most effective reading and writing processes; on skills and techniques for effective  
oral and written communication and for the creation of effective media texts; and on the  
language conventions needed for clear and coherent communication. In addition, it empha-  
sizes the use of higher-level thinking skills, including critical literacy skills, to enable students  
to understand, appreciate, and evaluate what they read and view at a deeper level, and to  
help them become reflective, critical, and independent learners.

In implementing this curriculum, teachers will help students to see that language skills are  
lifelong learning skills that will enable them to better understand themselves and others,  
unlock their potential as human beings, find fulfilling careers, and become responsible  
world citizens. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENGLISH PROGRAMS Students
-------------------------------------------------------

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make   
the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon  
discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and  
will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will  
find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges  
they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely impor-  
tant to these students success. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and  
learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances.

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with the language curriculum requires work,  
study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue  
opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of the  
communication process. Their understanding and skills will grow as they explore their  
world and engage in activities, for their own purposes, that involve reading, writing,

speaking, listening, viewing, and representing. Students develop their literacy skills when  
they seek out recreational reading materials and multimedia works that relate to their  
personal interests and to other subject areas, and when they engage in conversation with  
parents, peers, and teachers about what they are reading, writing, viewing, representing,  
and thinking in their daily lives.

Parents
-------

Parents

2 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show 

that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education.   
By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in  
the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This  
awareness will enhance parents ability to discuss their children s work with them, to  
communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children s progress.  
Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret  
teachers comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their   
children s learning.

Effective ways in which parents can support their children s learning include attending  
parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops and school council activities  
(including becoming a school council member), and encouraging their children to com-  
plete their assignments at home. 

In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to encourage their  
sons and daughters to take an active interest in using language for meaningful purposes  
as a regular part of their activities outside school. They might encourage them to read  
every day; take out a library membership; join a book club, a computer club, a camera  
club, or a community group; or subscribe to an age-appropriate magazine. They might  
also initiate conversations at home about what their daughters and sons are reading. 

Teachers
--------

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropri-  
ate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well  
as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers bring  
enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing  
different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student.

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide  
numerous opportunities for students to develop the literacy and language skills that will  
allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active  
citizens. The study of literature and the media provides students with an awareness and  
appreciation of the culture that surrounds, challenges, and nourishes them.

Principals
----------

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student  
has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, prin-  
cipals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms  
using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are  
made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects,  
including English, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate  
their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible  
for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving  
the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan in other words,  
for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

The English program in Grades 9 to 12 includes *compulsory courses
------------------*and *optional courses
----------------*.

The compulsory courses emphasize strong core competencies in listening, speaking, reading,  
writing, viewing, and representing. As part of their program in Grades 9 and 10, students  
must take one compulsory course in English in each grade. These courses are offered in  
two types, academic and applied.

3

One optional course is offered in the Grade 9 10 curriculum Literacy Skills: Reading and  
Writing, Grade 10. This course offers students an opportunity to enhance their literacy skills.  
It may be taken to fulfil an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional compul-  
sory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It may also be  
used, at the principal s discretion, as a substitution for one of the compulsory credits required  
in English. The Literacy Skills course is an open course.

Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and  
postsecondary goals. The course types offered in Grades 9 and 10 are defined as follows:

*Academic courses
----------------*

develop students knowledge and skills through the study of theory and

abstract problems. These courses focus on the essential concepts of a subject and explore  
related concepts as well. They incorporate practical applications as appropriate.

*Applied courses
---------------*

focus on the essential concepts of a subject, and develop students knowledge

and skills through practical applications and concrete examples. Familiar situations are  
used to illustrate ideas, and students are given more opportunities to experience hands-on  
applications of the concepts and theories they study.

*Open courses
------------*

are designed to prepare students for further study in the subject, and to

enrich their education generally. These courses comprise a set of expectations that are  
appropriate for all students.

School boards may offer a locally developed compulsory credit (LDCC) course in English  
in each of Grades 9 and 10, which may be used to meet the compulsory credit requirement  
in English for these grades.

4 The Grade 9 and 10 LDCC courses prepare students for suc-

cess in the Grade 11 English workplace preparation course.

THE PROGRAM 

IN ENGLISH

3. If the principal deems that the academic and applied courses in either Grade 9 or Grade 10 are sufficiently different,  
a student may take both courses and, on successful completion, earn a credit for each.   
4. If a student successfully completes both an LDCC course in Grade 9 or Grade 10 English and a curriculum course in English  
in the same grade, the principal may grant a credit for each course, bearing in mind that only one compulsory English credit is  
required in each grade. (The second credit can be used to meet an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional com-  
pulsory credit requirement.)

Half-Credit Courses
-------------------

The courses outlined in the Grade 9 12 English curriculum documents are designed   
as full-credit courses. However*, with the exception of Grade 12 university preparation and university/college preparation courses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses.

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instruction-  
al time, must adhere to the following conditions:

The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the  
expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be  
drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best  
enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time.

A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may  
be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both  
parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete  
both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.)

The title of each half-credit course must include the designation *Part 1
------*or *Part 2
------*. A  
half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card  
and the Ontario Student Transcript.

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described  
above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School  
October Report.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS
-----------------------

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that stu-  
dents are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in vari-  
ous other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand (or broad curriculum area) of every  
course overall expectations and specific expectations. The *overall expectations
--------------------*describe in  
general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the  
end of each course. The *specific expectations
---------------------*describe the expected knowledge and skills in  
greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered headings, or sub-  
organizers , each of which indicates the overall expectation to which the group of specific  
expectations corresponds. Each expectation in a group is identified by an expectation  
tag (a subheading) that describes the particular aspect of the overall expectation to  
which the specific expectation refers (see the illustration on page 13). 

Taken together, the overall and specific expectations represent the mandated curriculum.

In the core English curriculum (the compulsory courses offered in every grade), the *over-all expectations
---------------------*outline standard sets of knowledge and skills required for effective listen-  
ing and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. They encompass the  
types of understanding, skills, approaches, and processes that are applied by effective  
communicators of all ages and levels of development, and are therefore described in con-  
stant terms from grade to grade. The English curriculum focuses on developing the depth

and level of sophistication of students knowledge and skills associated with each of these  
key overall expectations by increasing the complexity of the texts they work with and the  
tasks they perform over time.

The *specific expectations
---------------------*reflect this progression in knowledge and skills from grade to  
grade, and also indicate differences between course types, through a combination of the  
following: (1) the wording of the expectation itself, (2) the examples that are given in  
parentheses in the expectation, and/or (3) the teacher prompts that may follow the expec-  
tation. The examples and teacher prompts help to clarify the requirements specified in the  
expectations and suggest the intended depth and level of complexity of the expectations.  
They have been developed to model appropriate practice for the particular grade and  
course type and are meant to serve as illustrations for teachers. Teachers can choose to  
use the examples and teacher prompts that are appropriate for their classrooms, or they  
may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the  
specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in  
the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the  
student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM*Compulsory Courses*
-----------------------------------------------------

The expectations in the compulsory courses of the English curriculum are organized in  
four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature  
Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. The program in all grades is designed to develop a  
range of essential skills in these four interrelated areas, built on a solid foundation of  
knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical,  
critical, and metacognitive thinking skills. Students learn best when they are encouraged  
to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations  
that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the  
four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to,  
create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in  
the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that  
blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of  
experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy  
skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

Oral Communication
------------------

Oral language is a fundamental means of communication with others and the cornerstone  
of learning in all areas. Through talk, students not only communicate information but  
also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems;  
organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings,  
and opinions. When they converse about information and ideas, they become aware not  
only of the various perspectives of other speakers and writers but also of the language  
structures and conventions they use. As students work towards achieving the expecta-  
tions for this strand, they will improve their ability to explore and communicate ideas in  
both classroom and formal speaking situations. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

|

English

14
--



  

To develop their oral communication skills, students need numerous opportunities to listen  
and to talk about a range of subjects, including personal interests, cultural knowledge,  
school work, and current affairs. The language program should provide opportunities   
for students to engage in various thought-provoking oral activities in connection with  
expectations in all the strands for example, brainstorming to identify what they know  
about the topic of a new text they are about to read, discussing strategies for solving a  
problem in a writing assignment, presenting and defending ideas or debating issues, and  
offering informal critiques of work produced by their peers. 

Listening and speaking are essential skills for social interaction at home, at school, and   
in the community. In order for all students to benefit from the opportunities provided in the  
classroom for listening and speaking, differences in the norms and conventions associated  
with oral communication in different cultures must be taken into account. In addition,   
for some students, the notion that learning involves talk is unfamiliar, and talk that sup-  
ports learning must be explicitly taught and modelled. All students can benefit from oppor-  
tunities to improve their listening and response skills and to refine their ideas and their  
ability to express them. The Oral Communication strand focuses on the identification and  
development of the skills and strategies effective listeners and speakers use to understand  
and interact with others. It also emphasizes the use of higher-order thinking skills to   
stimulate students interest and engage them in their own learning.

Reading and Literature Studies
------------------------------

Although many students entering the Grade 9 English program are fluent, independent  
readers, some may need additional support to develop their reading skills and to monitor  
their own progress. In addition, all students need instruction to cope with the more chal-  
lenging reading demands of the secondary school curriculum, which requires students to  
consider increasingly abstract concepts and to use language structures that are more com-  
plex and vocabulary that is more specialized than in earlier grades. The English program  
will help students learn to read efficiently and to absorb information quickly. 

The English curriculum focuses on developing the knowledge and skills that will enable  
students to become effective readers. An effective reader is one who not only grasps the  
ideas communicated in a text but is able to apply them in new contexts. To do this, the  
reader must be able to think clearly, creatively, and critically about the ideas and informa-  
tion encountered in texts in order to understand, analyse, and absorb them and to recog-  
nize their relevance in other contexts. Students can develop the skills necessary to become  
effective readers by applying a range of comprehension strategies as they read and by  
reading a wide variety of texts. It is also important that they read a range of materials that  
illustrate the many uses of writing. By reading widely, students will develop a richer  
vocabulary and become more attuned to the conventions of written language. Reading  
various kinds of texts in all areas of the curriculum will also help students to discover  
what interests them most and to pursue and develop their interests and abilities.

Reading is a complex process that involves the application of various strategies before,  
during, and after reading. For example, before reading, students might prepare by identi-  
fying the purpose of the reading activity and by activating their prior knowledge about  
the topic of the text. Teachers help build the necessary background knowledge for stu-  
dents whose life experiences may not have provided them with the information they  
need to understand the text. During reading, students may use cueing systems that is,

clues from context or from their understanding of language structures and/or letter-sound  
relationships to help them solve unfamiliar words, and comprehension strategies to help  
them make meaning of the text. Comprehension strategies include predicting, visualizing,  
questioning, drawing inferences, identifying main ideas, summarizing, and monitoring  
and revising comprehension. After reading, students may analyse, synthesize, make con-  
nections, evaluate, and use other critical and creative thinking skills to achieve a deeper  
understanding of the material they have read. It is important to note that although the  
specific expectations for each grade may focus on particular strategies that emphasize  
grade-appropriate skills, they do not impose a restriction on the range of strategies students  
will apply in that grade. Teachers must use their professional judgement in deciding which  
comprehension strategies to model and teach, based on the identified learning needs of  
the students in their classrooms and on the nature of the particular texts students are reading.

Fluent, independent readers read frequently for a variety of different purposes to locate  
information, to satisfy curiosity, for enjoyment, to build vocabulary, for research, and for  
various more specifically defined purposes. The purpose for reading will be determined  
by the teacher in some cases and by the student in others. The reading program should  
include a wide variety of literary, informational, and graphic texts that engage students   
interest and imagination for example, novels; poetry; myths, fables, and folk tales; short  
stories; textbooks and books on topics in science, history, mathematics, geography, and  
other subjects; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and journals; plays and radio, film,  
or television scripts; encyclopaedia entries; graphs, charts, and diagrams in textbooks or  
magazine articles; instructions and manuals; graphic novels, comic books, and cartoons;  
newspaper articles and editorials; databases and websites; and essays and reports.  
Teachers routinely provide materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world   
cultures, including the cultures of Aboriginal peoples. Within each course and from one  
grade to another, students should be assigned texts of increasing complexity as they  
develop their reading skills, and should also have many opportunities to select their   
own reading materials. Frequent exposure to good writing will inspire students to work  
towards high standards in their own writing and will help them develop an appreciation  
for the power and beauty of the written word.

The study of literature is central in the secondary English curriculum; it offers students  
opportunities to expand their intellectual horizons and to extend and strengthen their lit-  
eracy skills. As a creative representation of life and experience, literature raises important  
questions about the human condition, now and in the past. As students increase their  
knowledge of accomplished writers and literary works, and vicariously experience times,  
events, cultures, and values different from their own, they deepen their understanding of  
the many dimensions of human thought and human experience. 

All students, regardless of their postsecondary plans, need to read a balance of exemplary  
literary, informational, and graphic texts that nourish the imagination, promote intellectu-  
al growth, contribute to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, and provide a broad range of  
language models for their own writing. They should be exposed to literary works drawn  
from many genres, historical periods, and cultures, by both female and male writers, that  
represent a wide range of perspectives and reflect the diversity of Canada and the world.

This strand helps students learn to read with understanding, to read critically, to become  
familiar with various text forms and their characteristic elements, and to recognize the  
function and effects of various text features and stylistic devices. It helps students

understand that reading is a process of constructing meaning and equips them with the  
strategies that good readers use to understand and appreciate what they read.

Writing
-------

*Writing provides students with powerful opportunities to learn about themselves andtheir connections to the world. Through writing, students organize their thoughts, rememberimportant information, solve problems, reflect on a widening range of perspectives, andlearn how to communicate effectively for specific purposes and audiences. They findtheir voice and have opportunities to explore other voices. By putting their thoughtsinto words and supporting the words with visual images in a range of media, studentsacquire knowledge and deepen their understanding of the content in all school subjects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Ministry of Education, *Literacy for Learning, 2004*, p. 79

A central goal of the Writing strand is to promote students growth as confident writers and  
researchers who can communicate competently using a range of forms and styles to suit  
specific purposes and audiences and correctly applying the conventions of language   
grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. These conventions are best learned in the  
context of meaningful and creative writing activities that allow students to develop the  
ability to think and write clearly and effectively.

Writing, from initial musings to final publication, is a complex process that involves a  
range of complementary thinking and composing skills, as well as other language  
processes, including reading, speaking, and listening. As writers compose, they consider  
their audience; make decisions about form, style, and organization; and apply their  
knowledge of language use. To develop these competencies, students need a supportive  
classroom environment, with opportunities to extend and refine their skills in using the  
writing process and doing research. At the secondary level, teachers continue to teach  
and model effective strategies and skills, as well as provide appropriate scaffolding for  
students who are building skills and working towards independence. Students need  
opportunities to apply these skills and to write daily, in many forms and genres, for a  
variety of purposes and audiences, and within different time constraints. The forms and  
genres explored may include essays, reports, short stories, poetry, scripts, journals, letters,  
biographies, children s stories, articles, reviews, pr cis, explanations, instructions, notes,  
procedures, r sum s, and advertisements. Because postsecondary institutions and  
employers require clear, well-organized writing, on demand and within strict timelines,  
students also need to learn and practise strategies for writing effectively and correctly in  
the context of in-class writing assignments and test situations.

Students benefit from opportunities to produce writing that is interesting and original and  
that reflects their capacity for independent critical thought. Writing activities that students  
find meaningful and that challenge them to think creatively about topics and concerns that  
interest them will lead to a fuller and more lasting command of the essential skills of writing. 

The overall expectations in this strand focus on the elements of effective writing  
(ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, language conventions,  
and presentation) and on the stages of the recursive writing process (planning for writing,  
drafting, revising, editing and proofreading, and publishing). In the specific expectations,  
the examples and teacher prompts refer to writing forms and language conventions that  
are appropriate for instruction in the given course. The forms and conventions noted are  
not, however, the only ones that may be taught in the course, nor are they exclusive to the

course. Teachers will continue to make professional decisions about which writing forms  
and language conventions they will cover in every course, based on the identified learning  
needs of the students in their classrooms. 

Media Studies
-------------

Media Studies focuses on the art, meaning, and messaging of various forms of media texts.  
Media texts can be understood to include any work, object, or event that communicates  
meaning to an audience. Most media texts use words, graphics, sounds, and/or images, in  
print, oral, visual, or electronic form, to communicate information and ideas to their audi-  
ence. Whereas traditional English language study may be seen to focus primarily on the  
understanding of the word, media studies focuses on the construction of meaning through  
the combination of several media languages images, sounds, graphics, and words.

Media Studies explores the impact and influence of mass media and popular culture by  
examining texts such as films, songs, video games, action figures, advertisements, CD  
covers, clothing, billboards, television shows, magazines, newspapers, photographs, and  
websites.

5 These texts abound in our electronic information age, and the messages they

convey, both overt and implied, can have a significant influence on students lives. For  
this reason, critical thinking as it applies to media products and messages assumes a   
special significance. Understanding how media texts are constructed and why they are  
produced enables students to respond to them intelligently and responsibly. Students  
must be able to differentiate between fact and opinion; evaluate the credibility of sources;  
recognize bias; be attuned to discriminatory portrayals of individuals and groups, such as  
religious or sexual minorities, people with disabilities, or seniors; and question depictions  
of violence and crime.

Students repertoire of communication skills should include the ability to critically inter-  
pret the messages they receive through the various media and to use these media to com-  
municate their own ideas effectively as well. Skills related to high-tech media such as the  
Internet, film, and television are particularly important because of the power and perva-  
sive influence these media wield in our lives and in society. Becoming conversant with  
these and other media can greatly expand the range of information sources available to  
students, and enhance potential career opportunities in the communication and entertain-  
ment industries.

To develop their media literacy skills, students should have opportunities to view,  
analyse, and discuss a wide variety of media texts and relate them to their own experi-  
ence. They should also have opportunities to use available technologies to create media  
texts of different types (e.g., computer graphics, cartoons, graphic designs and layouts,  
radio plays, short videos, web pages).

5. Teachers should make students aware that images, print materials, music, or video clips used in connection with  
tasks and assignments may be subject to copyright, and the appropriate releases should be obtained prior to use. This  
applies to items downloaded from the Internet as well.



  

This strand focuses on helping students develop the skills required to understand, create,  
and critically interpret media texts. It examines how images (both moving and still),  
sound, and words are used, independently and in combination, to create meaning. It  
explores the use and significance of particular conventions and techniques in the media  
and considers the roles of the viewer and the producer in constructing meaning in media  
texts. Students apply the knowledge and skills gained through analysis of media texts as  
they create their own texts.

In the specific expectations in this strand, the examples and teacher prompts refer to  
media forms and conventions that are appropriate for instruction in the given course.  
These are not, however, the only forms and conventions that students may explore in the  
course, nor are they exclusive to the course. Teachers will continue to use their profes-  
sional judgement to decide on the forms and conventions students will study in every  
course, based on the identified learning needs of the students in their classrooms.

*Optional Courses
----------------*The expectations in the optional courses in the English program are clustered in strands  
suited to the particular theme or focus of the course. 

The Grade 10 optional course, Literacy Skills: Reading and Writing, contains two strands:  
Reading Skills and Writing Skills.

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information  
gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses  
in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also  
serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students   
needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices.

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including  
assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects  
how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of  
assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts  
towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student  
work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and  
the achievement levels outlined in this document.

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they  
lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evalua-  
tion strategies that:

address both what students learn and how well they learn;

are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement  
level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 24 25; 

are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide  
opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 

are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the  
needs and experiences of the students;

AND EVALUATION

are fair to all students; 

accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with  
the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 

accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction  
(English or French);

ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 

promote students ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 

include the use of samples of students work that provide evidence of   
their achievement; 

are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or  
the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses  
on students achievement of the overall expectations. A student s achievement of the  
overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific  
expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations  
define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the over-  
all expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which spe-  
cific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and  
which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observa-  
tion) but not necessarily evaluated.

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 24 25) for level 3 represent the  
 provincial standard for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture  
of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in English can be constructed by reading  
from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed 70 79%  
(Level 3) . Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will  
be prepared for work in subsequent courses.

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still  
reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard.  
Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that  
achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond  
those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or  
almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability  
to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student  
achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR ENGLISH
---------------------------------

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in  
English. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers.  
It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear per-  
formance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to:

provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for   
all courses outlined in this document; 

guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 

help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 

assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students;

provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate   
students learning.

Categories of Knowledge and Skills
----------------------------------

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and  
skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four  
categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and intercon-  
nectedness of learning.

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows:

*Knowledge and Understanding.
----------------------------*

Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowl-

edge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

*Thinking.
---------*

The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:

planning skills (e.g., generating ideas, gathering information, focusing research,  
organizing information)

processing skills (e.g., drawing inferences, interpreting, analysing, synthesizing,  
evaluating)

critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., oral discourse, research, critical analysis,  
critical literacy, metacognition, creative process)

*Communication.
--------------*

The conveying of meaning through various text forms.

*Application.
------------*

The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between

various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced man-  
ner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is  
considered within the appropriate categories.

Criteria
--------

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of  
the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and  
Understanding, the criteria are knowledge of content (e.g., forms of text; strategies used  
when listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing; elements of  
style; literary terminology, concepts, and theories; language conventions) and under-  
standing of content (e.g., concepts; ideas; opinions; relationships among facts, ideas, con-  
cepts, themes) . The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed  
and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for.

Descriptors
-----------

A descriptor indicates the characteristic of the student s performance, with respect to   
a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement  
chart, *effectiveness
-------------*is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication,  
and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task  
will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may  
therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic,  
relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particu-  
lar criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might  
focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication  
category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in  
the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections.  
Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might  
focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an  
explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific  
knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better under-  
stand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated.

Qualifiers
----------

A specific qualifier is used to define each of the four levels of achievement that is,  
*limited
-------*for level 1, *some
----*for level 2, *considerable
------------*for level 3, and a *high degree
-----------*or *thorough
--------*for  
level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of perform-  
ance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student s performance at   
level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: the student  
uses planning skills with *considerable
------------*effectiveness . 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify  
the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, stu-  
dents should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent  
of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowl-  
edge and skills.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means  
of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12. The report card provides a record of the stu-  
dent s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in  
the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade rep-  
resents the quality of the student s overall achievement of the expectations for the course  
and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart  
for the discipline.

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every  
course in which the student s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in  
Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows:

Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout  
the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student s most consistent  
level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should  
be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an  
examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to   
the course content and administered towards the end of the course.

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS
-----------------------------------------

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in  
every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization,  
Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale   
(E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation  
and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students   
achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of  
learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation  
in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades.

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the premise that *all students can be successful languagelearners
-----------------------------------------------*. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality  
instruction. 

Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students strengths and address their  
learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose  
for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for   
individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and  
model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and  
learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practise and  
apply their developing knowledge and skills.

SOME

CONSIDERATIONS FOR

PROGRAM PLANNING 



  

Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills  
and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fair-  
ness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

Motivating students and instilling positive habits of mind, such as a willingness and  
determination to persist, to think and communicate with clarity and precision, to take  
responsible risks, and to question and pose problems, are also integral to high-quality  
language instruction.

Language is best learned through activities that present stimulating ideas, issues, and  
themes that are meaningful to students. Since no single instructional approach can meet  
all the needs of each learner, teachers select classroom activities that are based on an  
assessment of students individual needs, proven learning theory, and best practices. In  
effective English programs, teachers introduce a rich variety of activities that integrate  
expectations from different strands and provide for the explicit teaching of knowledge  
and skills. They also provide frequent opportunities for students to rehearse, practise, and  
apply skills and strategies, and to make their own choices. 

PLANNING ENGLISH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs.  
They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with  
special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. *Special EducationTransformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table onSpecial Education, 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for  
students with special education needs *in all disciplines
------------------*. Those beliefs are as follows:

All students can succeed. 

Universal design and differentiated instruction are effective and interconnected  
means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students.

Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research,   
tempered by experience.

Classroom teachers are key educators for a student s literacy and numeracy   
development.

Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning.

Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning  
environment that supports students with special education needs.

Fairness is not sameness. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and  
needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance  
tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest pos-  
sible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for  
instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs  
that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.

In planning English courses for students with special education needs, teachers should  
begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths

and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are  
expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the fol-  
lowing options is appropriate for the student: 

no accommodations

6 or modifications; or 

accommodations only; or 

modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or

alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations  
for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the rele-  
vant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or  
her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs  
for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative  
programs and/or courses, can be found in *The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A ResourceGuide, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*). For a detailed discussion  
of the ministry s requirements for IEPs, see *Individual Education Plans: Standards forDevelopment, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as *IEPStandards, 2000
------------------*). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only
--------------------------------------

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course  
curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to  
the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student s learning must be  
identified in his or her IEP (see *IEP Standards, 2000
-------------------*, page 11). A student s IEP is likely to  
reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first  
option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design  
and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the  
diverse needs of learners.

There are three types of accommodations:

*Instructional accommodations
----------------------------*are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of  
presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 

*Environmental accommodations
----------------------------*are changes that the student may require in the class-  
room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 

*Assessment accommodations
-------------------------*are changes in assessment procedures that enable the  
student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to  
complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see  
page 29 of the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*, for more examples). 

If a student requires accommodations only in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expecta-  
tions and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student s  
Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of  
accommodations will be included.

6. Accommodations refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or   
individualized equipment.



  

Students Requiring Modified Expectations
----------------------------------------

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course  
expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular  
course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations.  
Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achieve-  
ments and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate  
independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student s IEP, the extent to which  
expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry s policy docu-  
ment *Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, the  
principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes  
successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to  
receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and  
the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course,  
the modified expectations should identify *how the required knowledge and skills differ fromthose identified in the course expectations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*. When modifications are so extensive that achieve-  
ment of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely  
to result in a credit, the expectations should *specify the precise requirements or tasks on whichthe student s performance will be evaluated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*and which will be used to generate the course  
mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate and have assessed *in each reporting period
------------------------*(*IEP Standards, 2000,
--------------------*pages 10 and 11).  
The student s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student s progress  
at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (*IEP Standards,2000
------------------*, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP  
and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student s learn-  
ing expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for  
the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If,  
however, the student s learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the prin-  
cipal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked  
and the appropriate statement from the *Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12,1999
-----------------------------------------------------*(page 8) must be inserted. The teacher s comments should include relevant informa-  
tion on the student s demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next  
steps for the student s learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
----------------------------------------------------

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The  
first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario s English language  
schools is a language other than English. Ontario s linguistic heritage includes several  
Aboriginal languages; many African, Asian, and European languages; and some varieties  
of English, such as Jamaican Creole. Many English language learners were born in  
Canada and raised in families and communities in which languages other than English

were spoken, or in which the variety of English spoken differed significantly from the  
English of Ontario classrooms. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as new-  
comers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educa-  
tional systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling  
was limited.

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic  
and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for their English lan-  
guage development.

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional  
language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge  
and experience to the classroom. These students linguistic and cultural backgrounds not  
only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in  
the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity  
into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment.

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in  
their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school,  
there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued develop-  
ment of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage  
parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foun-  
dation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers  
to find opportunities to bring students languages into the classroom, using parents and  
community members as a resource.

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive  
support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting  
their language-learning needs:

*English as a Second Language (ESL)
----------------------------------*

programs are for students born in Canada or new-

comers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English  
significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

*English Literacy Development (ELD)
----------------------------------*

programs are primarily for newcomers whose first

language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different  
from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in  
their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education  
is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills  
in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may  
also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from  
ELD instruction.

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teach-  
ers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every  
learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and  
at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language  
acquisition may go through a silent period during which they closely observe the inter-  
actions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use  
body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have

gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and  
responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nur-  
tures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When  
they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some   
students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while  
others will speak quite fluently.

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young  
children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts  
and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in  
English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student s knowledge of vocab-  
ulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language profi-  
ciency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success.  
Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to  
catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic pur-  
poses. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the language  
knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they  
require from their teachers.

Responsibility for students English-language development is shared by the classroom  
teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and  
peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language class-  
room. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of  
these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include:

modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging  
but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given  
the necessary support from the teacher; 

use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic  
organizers, scaffolding; previewing of textbooks, pre-teaching of key vocabulary;  
peer tutoring; strategic use of students first languages); 

use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual   
dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 

use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral inter-  
views, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of  
graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assess-  
ment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner  
(whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must  
be clearly indicated on the student s report card.

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students  
who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adapta-  
tions to be successful.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION Overview
-------------------------------------

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects   
of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to high  
standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of  
identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value  
and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to  
adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence,  
and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves  
and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships,  
and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools also have the opportunity to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the  
diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a  
variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members  
from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays,  
concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with  
the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach  
and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

Antidiscrimination Education in the English Program
---------------------------------------------------

Learning resources that reflect the broad range of students interests, backgrounds, cultures,  
and experiences are an important aspect of an inclusive English program. In such a program,  
learning materials involve protagonists of both sexes from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Teachers routinely use materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world cultures,  
including those of contemporary First Nations, M tis, and Inuit peoples, and make them  
available to students. Short stories, novels, magazine and newspaper articles, television  
programs, and films provide opportunities for students to explore issues relating to their  
self-identity. In inclusive programs, students are made aware of the historical, cultural,  
and political contexts for both the traditional and non-traditional gender and social roles  
represented in the materials they are studying. 

Stories, novels, informational texts, and media works relating to the immigrant experience  
provide rich thematic material for study, as well as the opportunity for students new to  
Canada to share their knowledge and experiences with others. In addition, in the context  
of the English program, both students and teachers should become aware of aspects of  
intercultural communication for example, by exploring how different cultures interpret  
the use of eye contact and body language in conversation and during presentations.

Resources should be chosen not only to reflect diversity but also on the basis of their  
appeal for both girls and boys in the classroom. Recent research has shown that many  
boys are interested in informational materials, such as manuals and graphic texts, as  
opposed to works of fiction, which are often more appealing to girls. Both sexes read  
Internet materials, such as website articles, e-mail, and chat messages, outside the class-  
room. *Me Read? No Way! A Practical Guide to Improving Boys Literacy Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------*(available on the  
Ministry of Education website) provides a number of useful literacy strategies that focus  
on engaging boys in reading and writing and that can enhance the learning environment  
for both female and male students.

The development of critical thinking skills is integral to the English curriculum. In the  
context of what is now called critical literacy , these skills include the ability to identify  
perspectives, values, and issues; detect bias; and read for implicit as well as overt mean-  
ing. In the English program, students develop the ability to detect negative bias and  
stereotypes in literary texts and informational materials. When using biased informa-  
tional texts, or literary works containing negative stereotypes, for the express purpose of  
critical analysis, teachers must take into account the potential negative impact of bias on  
students and use appropriate strategies to address students responses.

Critical literacy also involves asking questions and challenging the status quo, and leads  
students to look at issues of power and justice in society. The program empowers stu-  
dents by enabling them to express themselves and to speak out about issues that strongly  
affect them.

Literature studies and media studies also afford both students and teachers a unique  
opportunity to explore the social and emotional impact of bullying, violence, and discrim-  
ination in the form of racism, sexism, or homophobia on individuals and families.  
Teachers can help students link the understanding they gain in this regard to messages  
conveyed through the school s antibullying and violence-prevention programming.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students success  
in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

The acquisition and development of literacy skills is clearly the focus of the English cur-  
riculum, but the English program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical  
literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams,  
charts, tables, and graphs, and the English curriculum emphasizes students ability to  
interpret and use graphic texts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In English courses, students are  
encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible  
answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to  
locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, diction-  
aries, encyclopaedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised  
in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of informa-  
tion have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a  
responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropri-  
ate ways. The ability to locate, question, and validate information allows a student to  
become an independent, lifelong learner.

THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------

The school library program can help to build and transform students knowledge to support  
lifelong learning in our information- and knowledge-based society. The school library  
program supports student success across the language curriculum by encouraging students  
to read widely, teaching them to read for understanding and enjoyment, and helping them  
to improve their research skills and to use information gathered through research effectively. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

The school library program enables students to:

develop a love of reading for learning and for pleasure; 

acquire an understanding of the richness and diversity of literary and informational   
texts produced in Canada and around the world; 

obtain access to programs, resources, and integrated technologies that support   
all curriculum areas; 

understand and value the role of public library systems as a resource for   
lifelong learning.

The school library program plays a key role in the development of information literacy  
and research skills. In collaboration with classroom or content-area teachers, teacher-  
librarians develop, teach, and provide students with authentic information and research  
tasks that foster learning, including the ability to:

locate, select, gather, critically evaluate, create, and communicate information;

use the information obtained to solve problems, make decisions, build knowledge,   
create personal meaning, and enrich their lives; 

communicate their findings for different audiences, using a variety of formats   
and technologies; 

use information and research with understanding, responsibility, and imagination.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can   
significantly extend and enrich teachers instructional strategies and support students   
language learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites,  
digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to  
collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on  
their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect  
students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into  
the local classroom.

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support  
and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in  
groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to museums  
and archives in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and  
projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates.

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its  
use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible  
use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to  
promote hatred.

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-  
class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to  
learning to meet diverse student needs.

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS
------------------------------------------------

Teachers planning programs in English need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of  
the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that  
enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school work  
connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text,  
Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and  
includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how  
workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are  
used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work  
habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service.  
The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students demonstration of  
these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can  
use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill  
development, and show employers what they can do. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada  
and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through  
extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills  
provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their  
jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the  
Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca.

CAREER EDUCATION
----------------

Expectations in the English program include many opportunities for students to apply  
their language skills to work-related situations, to explore educational and career options,  
and to become self-directed learners. To prepare students for the literacy demands of a  
wide array of postsecondary educational programs and careers, English courses require  
students to develop research skills, practise expository writing, and learn strategies for  
understanding informational reading materials. Making oral presentations and working  
in small groups with classmates help students express themselves confidently and work  
cooperatively with others. Regardless of their postsecondary destination, all students need  
to realize that literacy skills are employability skills. Powerful literacy skills will equip  
students to manage information technologies, communicate effectively and correctly in a  
variety of situations, and perform a variety of tasks required in most work environments.

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing,  
field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed  
in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and  
public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to  
broaden students knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields,  
including publishing, advertising, and media-related industries. In addition, students  
develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of  
employer employee relationships. Teachers of English can support their students learning  
by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access  
to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education  
and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace  
learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand  
the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part  
in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed  
for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality  
as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the  
right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be  
aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal  
safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies  
and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for  
Students in Work Education Programs (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring  
the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least  
14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing  
or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the  
minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons  
to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and  
other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry s policy  
document entitled *Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policiesand Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH-SKILLS MAJOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

English courses are well suited for inclusion in programs leading to a Specialist High-  
Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular appren-  
ticeship or workplace destinations. In an SHSM program, English courses can be bundled  
with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular  
industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education,  
including apprenticeship. English courses may also be combined with cooperative educa-  
tion credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for  
various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM pro-  
grams would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers,  
skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
----------------------------------------

Although health and safety issues are not usually associated with language education, they  
may be important when the learning involves fieldwork. Out-of-school fieldwork can  
provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students learning experiences. Teachers  
must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students health and safety.

individual students the opportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests.  
The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options  
outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable students to better customize their  
high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY, LANGUAGE, AND THEENGLISH CURRICULUM
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Literacy is about more than reading or writing it is about how we communicate in society. It is about social practices and relationships, about knowledge, language and culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Those who use literacy take it for granted but those who cannot use it are excludedfrom much communication in today s world. Indeed, it is the excluded who can bestappreciate the notion of literacy as freedom .

UNESCO, Statement for the United Nations Literacy Decade, 2003 2012

Literacy development is a communal project, and the teaching of literacy skills is embedded  
across the Ontario curriculum. However, it is the English curriculum that is dedicated to  
developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based that is, knowledge and  
skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing.

Language development is central to students intellectual, social, cultural, and emotional  
growth and must be seen as a key component of the curriculum. When students learn to  
use language, they do more than master the basic skills. They learn to value the power   
of language and to use it responsibly. They learn to express feelings and opinions and to  
support their opinions with sound arguments and evidence from research. They become  
aware of the many purposes for which language is used and the diverse forms it can take  
to serve particular purposes and audiences. They learn to use the formal language appro-  
priate for debates and essays, the narrative language of stories and novels, the figurative  
language of poetry, the technical language of instructions and manuals. They develop   
an awareness of how language is used in different formal and informal situations. They  
come to understand that language is an important medium for communicating ideas and

information, expressing world views, and realizing and communicating artistic vision.  
Students learn that language can be not only used as a tool but also appreciated and enjoyed.

Language is the basis for thinking, communicating, learning, and viewing the world.  
Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact  
socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and  
demonstrate their learning. Learning to communicate with clarity and precision will help  
students to thrive in the world beyond school.

Language is a fundamental element of identity and culture. As students read and reflect  
on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,

1 they develop a deeper under-

standing of themselves and others and of the world around them. If they see themselves  
and others in the texts they study, they will be more engaged in learning and they will  
also come to appreciate the nature and value of a diverse, multicultural society. They will  
develop the ability to understand and critically interpret a range of texts and to recognize  
that a text conveys one particular perspective among many.

Language skills are developed across the curriculum and, cumulatively, through the grades.  
Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics,  
themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all  
subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability  
to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students  
develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time.  
As they move through the secondary school program, they are required to use language  
with ever-increasing accuracy and fluency in an expanding range of situations. They are  
also expected to assume responsibility for their own learning and to apply their language  
skills in more challenging and complex ways.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM
--------------------------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible  
and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners.  
The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they  
need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

Successful language learners:

understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;

communicate that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent effectively  
and with confidence;

make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts,  
and the world around them;

think critically;

understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized,  
questioned, assessed, and evaluated;

appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;

use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal  
growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

1. The word *text* is used in this document in its broadest sense, as a means of communication that uses words, graphics,  
sounds, and/or images to convey information and ideas to an audience.



  

The English curriculum takes into account that students in Ontario come from a wide  
variety of backgrounds and that every student has a unique set of perspectives, strengths,  
and needs. Instructional strategies and resources that recognize and reflect the diversity in  
the classroom and that suit individual strengths and needs are therefore critical to student  
success. Reading activities should expose students to materials that reflect the diversity of  
Canadian and world cultures, including those of Aboriginal peoples. Students also need  
to become familiar with the works of recognized writers from their own and earlier eras.  
By reading a wide range of materials and being challenged by what they read, students  
become receptive to new and widely varying ideas and perspectives, and develop their  
ability to think independently and critically.

Research has shown that when students are given opportunities to choose what they   
read and what they write about, they are more likely to discover and pursue their own  
interests. In keeping with this finding, the curriculum requires that students select some  
of the texts they read and decide on the topic, purpose, and audience for some of the  
works they produce.

Research has also shown that effective readers and writers unconsciously apply a range  
of skills and strategies as they read and write. By identifying and explicitly teaching these  
skills and strategies, teachers enable all students to become effective communicators. The  
English curriculum focuses on comprehension strategies for listening, viewing, and reading;  
on the most effective reading and writing processes; on skills and techniques for effective  
oral and written communication and for the creation of effective media texts; and on the  
language conventions needed for clear and coherent communication. In addition, it empha-  
sizes the use of higher-level thinking skills, including critical literacy skills, to enable students  
to understand, appreciate, and evaluate what they read and view at a deeper level, and to  
help them become reflective, critical, and independent learners.

In implementing this curriculum, teachers will help students to see that language skills are  
lifelong learning skills that will enable them to better understand themselves and others,  
unlock their potential as human beings, find fulfilling careers, and become responsible  
world citizens. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENGLISH PROGRAMS Students
-------------------------------------------------------

Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning. Students who make   
the effort required to succeed in school and who are able to apply themselves will soon  
discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and  
will therefore be more motivated to work. There will be some students, however, who will  
find it more difficult to take responsibility for their learning because of special challenges  
they face. The attention, patience, and encouragement of teachers can be extremely impor-  
tant to these students success. However, taking responsibility for their own progress and  
learning is an important part of education for all students, regardless of their circumstances.

Mastering the concepts and skills connected with the language curriculum requires work,  
study, and the development of cooperative skills. In addition, students who actively pursue  
opportunities outside the classroom will extend and enrich their understanding of the  
communication process. Their understanding and skills will grow as they explore their  
world and engage in activities, for their own purposes, that involve reading, writing,

speaking, listening, viewing, and representing. Students develop their literacy skills when  
they seek out recreational reading materials and multimedia works that relate to their  
personal interests and to other subject areas, and when they engage in conversation with  
parents, peers, and teachers about what they are reading, writing, viewing, representing,  
and thinking in their daily lives.

Parents
-------

Parents

2 have an important role to play in supporting student learning. Studies show 

that students perform better in school if their parents are involved in their education.   
By becoming familiar with the curriculum, parents can determine what is being taught in  
the courses their daughters and sons are taking and what they are expected to learn. This  
awareness will enhance parents ability to discuss their children s work with them, to  
communicate with teachers, and to ask relevant questions about their children s progress.  
Knowledge of the expectations in the various courses will also help parents to interpret  
teachers comments on student progress and to work with teachers to improve their   
children s learning.

Effective ways in which parents can support their children s learning include attending  
parent-teacher interviews, participating in parent workshops and school council activities  
(including becoming a school council member), and encouraging their children to com-  
plete their assignments at home. 

In addition to supporting regular school activities, parents may wish to encourage their  
sons and daughters to take an active interest in using language for meaningful purposes  
as a regular part of their activities outside school. They might encourage them to read  
every day; take out a library membership; join a book club, a computer club, a camera  
club, or a community group; or subscribe to an age-appropriate magazine. They might  
also initiate conversations at home about what their daughters and sons are reading. 

Teachers
--------

Teachers and students have complementary responsibilities. Teachers develop appropri-  
ate instructional strategies to help students achieve the curriculum expectations, as well  
as appropriate methods for assessing and evaluating student learning. Teachers bring  
enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing  
different student needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student.

Using a variety of instructional, assessment, and evaluation strategies, teachers provide  
numerous opportunities for students to develop the literacy and language skills that will  
allow them to participate more effectively in their communities as responsible and active  
citizens. The study of literature and the media provides students with an awareness and  
appreciation of the culture that surrounds, challenges, and nourishes them.

Principals
----------

The principal works in partnership with teachers and parents to ensure that each student  
has access to the best possible educational experience. To support student learning, prin-  
cipals ensure that the Ontario curriculum is being properly implemented in all classrooms  
using a variety of instructional approaches. They also ensure that appropriate resources are  
made available for teachers and students. To enhance teaching and learning in all subjects,  
including English, principals promote learning teams and work with teachers to facilitate  
their participation in professional development activities. Principals are also responsible  
for ensuring that every student who has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is receiving  
the modifications and/or accommodations described in his or her plan in other words,  
for ensuring that the IEP is properly developed, implemented, and monitored.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

The English program in Grades 9 to 12 includes *compulsory courses
------------------*and *optional courses
----------------*.

The compulsory courses emphasize strong core competencies in listening, speaking, reading,  
writing, viewing, and representing. As part of their program in Grades 9 and 10, students  
must take one compulsory course in English in each grade. These courses are offered in  
two types, academic and applied.

3

One optional course is offered in the Grade 9 10 curriculum Literacy Skills: Reading and  
Writing, Grade 10. This course offers students an opportunity to enhance their literacy skills.  
It may be taken to fulfil an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional compul-  
sory credit requirement for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It may also be  
used, at the principal s discretion, as a substitution for one of the compulsory credits required  
in English. The Literacy Skills course is an open course.

Students choose between course types on the basis of their interests, achievement, and  
postsecondary goals. The course types offered in Grades 9 and 10 are defined as follows:

*Academic courses
----------------*

develop students knowledge and skills through the study of theory and

abstract problems. These courses focus on the essential concepts of a subject and explore  
related concepts as well. They incorporate practical applications as appropriate.

*Applied courses
---------------*

focus on the essential concepts of a subject, and develop students knowledge

and skills through practical applications and concrete examples. Familiar situations are  
used to illustrate ideas, and students are given more opportunities to experience hands-on  
applications of the concepts and theories they study.

*Open courses
------------*

are designed to prepare students for further study in the subject, and to

enrich their education generally. These courses comprise a set of expectations that are  
appropriate for all students.

School boards may offer a locally developed compulsory credit (LDCC) course in English  
in each of Grades 9 and 10, which may be used to meet the compulsory credit requirement  
in English for these grades.

4 The Grade 9 and 10 LDCC courses prepare students for suc-

cess in the Grade 11 English workplace preparation course.

THE PROGRAM 

IN ENGLISH

3. If the principal deems that the academic and applied courses in either Grade 9 or Grade 10 are sufficiently different,  
a student may take both courses and, on successful completion, earn a credit for each.   
4. If a student successfully completes both an LDCC course in Grade 9 or Grade 10 English and a curriculum course in English  
in the same grade, the principal may grant a credit for each course, bearing in mind that only one compulsory English credit is  
required in each grade. (The second credit can be used to meet an optional credit requirement or the Group 1 additional com-  
pulsory credit requirement.)

Half-Credit Courses
-------------------

The courses outlined in the Grade 9 12 English curriculum documents are designed   
as full-credit courses. However*, with the exception of Grade 12 university preparation and university/college preparation courses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, they may also be delivered as half-credit courses.

Half-credit courses, which require a minimum of fifty-five hours of scheduled instruction-  
al time, must adhere to the following conditions:

The two half-credit courses created from a full course must together contain all of the  
expectations of the full course. The expectations for each half-credit course must be  
drawn from all strands of the full course and must be divided in a manner that best  
enables students to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time.

A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the secondary curriculum may  
be offered as two half-credit courses, but students must successfully complete both  
parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite. (Students are not required to complete  
both parts unless the course is a prerequisite for another course they wish to take.)

The title of each half-credit course must include the designation *Part 1
------*or *Part 2
------*. A  
half credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value column of both the report card  
and the Ontario Student Transcript.

Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the conditions described  
above, and will report all half-credit courses to the ministry annually in the School  
October Report.

CURRICULUM EXPECTATIONS
-----------------------

The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that stu-  
dents are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work, on tests, and in vari-  
ous other activities on which their achievement is assessed and evaluated. 

Two sets of expectations are listed for each strand (or broad curriculum area) of every  
course overall expectations and specific expectations. The *overall expectations
--------------------*describe in  
general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the  
end of each course. The *specific expectations
---------------------*describe the expected knowledge and skills in  
greater detail. The specific expectations are grouped under numbered headings, or sub-  
organizers , each of which indicates the overall expectation to which the group of specific  
expectations corresponds. Each expectation in a group is identified by an expectation  
tag (a subheading) that describes the particular aspect of the overall expectation to  
which the specific expectation refers (see the illustration on page 13). 

Taken together, the overall and specific expectations represent the mandated curriculum.

In the core English curriculum (the compulsory courses offered in every grade), the *over-all expectations
---------------------*outline standard sets of knowledge and skills required for effective listen-  
ing and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. They encompass the  
types of understanding, skills, approaches, and processes that are applied by effective  
communicators of all ages and levels of development, and are therefore described in con-  
stant terms from grade to grade. The English curriculum focuses on developing the depth

and level of sophistication of students knowledge and skills associated with each of these  
key overall expectations by increasing the complexity of the texts they work with and the  
tasks they perform over time.

The *specific expectations
---------------------*reflect this progression in knowledge and skills from grade to  
grade, and also indicate differences between course types, through a combination of the  
following: (1) the wording of the expectation itself, (2) the examples that are given in  
parentheses in the expectation, and/or (3) the teacher prompts that may follow the expec-  
tation. The examples and teacher prompts help to clarify the requirements specified in the  
expectations and suggest the intended depth and level of complexity of the expectations.  
They have been developed to model appropriate practice for the particular grade and  
course type and are meant to serve as illustrations for teachers. Teachers can choose to  
use the examples and teacher prompts that are appropriate for their classrooms, or they  
may develop their own approaches that reflect a similar level of complexity. Whatever the  
specific ways in which the requirements outlined in the expectations are implemented in  
the classroom, they must, wherever possible, be inclusive and reflect the diversity of the  
student population and the population of the province.

STRANDS IN THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM*Compulsory Courses*
-----------------------------------------------------

The expectations in the compulsory courses of the English curriculum are organized in  
four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature  
Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. The program in all grades is designed to develop a  
range of essential skills in these four interrelated areas, built on a solid foundation of  
knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical,  
critical, and metacognitive thinking skills. Students learn best when they are encouraged  
to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations  
that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the  
four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to,  
create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in  
the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that  
blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of  
experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy  
skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

Oral Communication
------------------

Oral language is a fundamental means of communication with others and the cornerstone  
of learning in all areas. Through talk, students not only communicate information but  
also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems;  
organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings,  
and opinions. When they converse about information and ideas, they become aware not  
only of the various perspectives of other speakers and writers but also of the language  
structures and conventions they use. As students work towards achieving the expecta-  
tions for this strand, they will improve their ability to explore and communicate ideas in  
both classroom and formal speaking situations. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

|

English

14
--



  

To develop their oral communication skills, students need numerous opportunities to listen  
and to talk about a range of subjects, including personal interests, cultural knowledge,  
school work, and current affairs. The language program should provide opportunities   
for students to engage in various thought-provoking oral activities in connection with  
expectations in all the strands for example, brainstorming to identify what they know  
about the topic of a new text they are about to read, discussing strategies for solving a  
problem in a writing assignment, presenting and defending ideas or debating issues, and  
offering informal critiques of work produced by their peers. 

Listening and speaking are essential skills for social interaction at home, at school, and   
in the community. In order for all students to benefit from the opportunities provided in the  
classroom for listening and speaking, differences in the norms and conventions associated  
with oral communication in different cultures must be taken into account. In addition,   
for some students, the notion that learning involves talk is unfamiliar, and talk that sup-  
ports learning must be explicitly taught and modelled. All students can benefit from oppor-  
tunities to improve their listening and response skills and to refine their ideas and their  
ability to express them. The Oral Communication strand focuses on the identification and  
development of the skills and strategies effective listeners and speakers use to understand  
and interact with others. It also emphasizes the use of higher-order thinking skills to   
stimulate students interest and engage them in their own learning.

Reading and Literature Studies
------------------------------

Although many students entering the Grade 9 English program are fluent, independent  
readers, some may need additional support to develop their reading skills and to monitor  
their own progress. In addition, all students need instruction to cope with the more chal-  
lenging reading demands of the secondary school curriculum, which requires students to  
consider increasingly abstract concepts and to use language structures that are more com-  
plex and vocabulary that is more specialized than in earlier grades. The English program  
will help students learn to read efficiently and to absorb information quickly. 

The English curriculum focuses on developing the knowledge and skills that will enable  
students to become effective readers. An effective reader is one who not only grasps the  
ideas communicated in a text but is able to apply them in new contexts. To do this, the  
reader must be able to think clearly, creatively, and critically about the ideas and informa-  
tion encountered in texts in order to understand, analyse, and absorb them and to recog-  
nize their relevance in other contexts. Students can develop the skills necessary to become  
effective readers by applying a range of comprehension strategies as they read and by  
reading a wide variety of texts. It is also important that they read a range of materials that  
illustrate the many uses of writing. By reading widely, students will develop a richer  
vocabulary and become more attuned to the conventions of written language. Reading  
various kinds of texts in all areas of the curriculum will also help students to discover  
what interests them most and to pursue and develop their interests and abilities.

Reading is a complex process that involves the application of various strategies before,  
during, and after reading. For example, before reading, students might prepare by identi-  
fying the purpose of the reading activity and by activating their prior knowledge about  
the topic of the text. Teachers help build the necessary background knowledge for stu-  
dents whose life experiences may not have provided them with the information they  
need to understand the text. During reading, students may use cueing systems that is,

clues from context or from their understanding of language structures and/or letter-sound  
relationships to help them solve unfamiliar words, and comprehension strategies to help  
them make meaning of the text. Comprehension strategies include predicting, visualizing,  
questioning, drawing inferences, identifying main ideas, summarizing, and monitoring  
and revising comprehension. After reading, students may analyse, synthesize, make con-  
nections, evaluate, and use other critical and creative thinking skills to achieve a deeper  
understanding of the material they have read. It is important to note that although the  
specific expectations for each grade may focus on particular strategies that emphasize  
grade-appropriate skills, they do not impose a restriction on the range of strategies students  
will apply in that grade. Teachers must use their professional judgement in deciding which  
comprehension strategies to model and teach, based on the identified learning needs of  
the students in their classrooms and on the nature of the particular texts students are reading.

Fluent, independent readers read frequently for a variety of different purposes to locate  
information, to satisfy curiosity, for enjoyment, to build vocabulary, for research, and for  
various more specifically defined purposes. The purpose for reading will be determined  
by the teacher in some cases and by the student in others. The reading program should  
include a wide variety of literary, informational, and graphic texts that engage students   
interest and imagination for example, novels; poetry; myths, fables, and folk tales; short  
stories; textbooks and books on topics in science, history, mathematics, geography, and  
other subjects; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and journals; plays and radio, film,  
or television scripts; encyclopaedia entries; graphs, charts, and diagrams in textbooks or  
magazine articles; instructions and manuals; graphic novels, comic books, and cartoons;  
newspaper articles and editorials; databases and websites; and essays and reports.  
Teachers routinely provide materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world   
cultures, including the cultures of Aboriginal peoples. Within each course and from one  
grade to another, students should be assigned texts of increasing complexity as they  
develop their reading skills, and should also have many opportunities to select their   
own reading materials. Frequent exposure to good writing will inspire students to work  
towards high standards in their own writing and will help them develop an appreciation  
for the power and beauty of the written word.

The study of literature is central in the secondary English curriculum; it offers students  
opportunities to expand their intellectual horizons and to extend and strengthen their lit-  
eracy skills. As a creative representation of life and experience, literature raises important  
questions about the human condition, now and in the past. As students increase their  
knowledge of accomplished writers and literary works, and vicariously experience times,  
events, cultures, and values different from their own, they deepen their understanding of  
the many dimensions of human thought and human experience. 

All students, regardless of their postsecondary plans, need to read a balance of exemplary  
literary, informational, and graphic texts that nourish the imagination, promote intellectu-  
al growth, contribute to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, and provide a broad range of  
language models for their own writing. They should be exposed to literary works drawn  
from many genres, historical periods, and cultures, by both female and male writers, that  
represent a wide range of perspectives and reflect the diversity of Canada and the world.

This strand helps students learn to read with understanding, to read critically, to become  
familiar with various text forms and their characteristic elements, and to recognize the  
function and effects of various text features and stylistic devices. It helps students

understand that reading is a process of constructing meaning and equips them with the  
strategies that good readers use to understand and appreciate what they read.

Writing
-------

*Writing provides students with powerful opportunities to learn about themselves andtheir connections to the world. Through writing, students organize their thoughts, rememberimportant information, solve problems, reflect on a widening range of perspectives, andlearn how to communicate effectively for specific purposes and audiences. They findtheir voice and have opportunities to explore other voices. By putting their thoughtsinto words and supporting the words with visual images in a range of media, studentsacquire knowledge and deepen their understanding of the content in all school subjects.

Ministry of Education, *Literacy for Learning, 2004*, p. 79

A central goal of the Writing strand is to promote students growth as confident writers and  
researchers who can communicate competently using a range of forms and styles to suit  
specific purposes and audiences and correctly applying the conventions of language   
grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. These conventions are best learned in the  
context of meaningful and creative writing activities that allow students to develop the  
ability to think and write clearly and effectively.

Writing, from initial musings to final publication, is a complex process that involves a  
range of complementary thinking and composing skills, as well as other language  
processes, including reading, speaking, and listening. As writers compose, they consider  
their audience; make decisions about form, style, and organization; and apply their  
knowledge of language use. To develop these competencies, students need a supportive  
classroom environment, with opportunities to extend and refine their skills in using the  
writing process and doing research. At the secondary level, teachers continue to teach  
and model effective strategies and skills, as well as provide appropriate scaffolding for  
students who are building skills and working towards independence. Students need  
opportunities to apply these skills and to write daily, in many forms and genres, for a  
variety of purposes and audiences, and within different time constraints. The forms and  
genres explored may include essays, reports, short stories, poetry, scripts, journals, letters,  
biographies, children s stories, articles, reviews, pr cis, explanations, instructions, notes,  
procedures, r sum s, and advertisements. Because postsecondary institutions and  
employers require clear, well-organized writing, on demand and within strict timelines,  
students also need to learn and practise strategies for writing effectively and correctly in  
the context of in-class writing assignments and test situations.

Students benefit from opportunities to produce writing that is interesting and original and  
that reflects their capacity for independent critical thought. Writing activities that students  
find meaningful and that challenge them to think creatively about topics and concerns that  
interest them will lead to a fuller and more lasting command of the essential skills of writing. 

The overall expectations in this strand focus on the elements of effective writing  
(ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, language conventions,  
and presentation) and on the stages of the recursive writing process (planning for writing,  
drafting, revising, editing and proofreading, and publishing). In the specific expectations,  
the examples and teacher prompts refer to writing forms and language conventions that  
are appropriate for instruction in the given course. The forms and conventions noted are  
not, however, the only ones that may be taught in the course, nor are they exclusive to the

course. Teachers will continue to make professional decisions about which writing forms  
and language conventions they will cover in every course, based on the identified learning  
needs of the students in their classrooms. 

Media Studies
-------------

Media Studies focuses on the art, meaning, and messaging of various forms of media texts.  
Media texts can be understood to include any work, object, or event that communicates  
meaning to an audience. Most media texts use words, graphics, sounds, and/or images, in  
print, oral, visual, or electronic form, to communicate information and ideas to their audi-  
ence. Whereas traditional English language study may be seen to focus primarily on the  
understanding of the word, media studies focuses on the construction of meaning through  
the combination of several media languages images, sounds, graphics, and words.

Media Studies explores the impact and influence of mass media and popular culture by  
examining texts such as films, songs, video games, action figures, advertisements, CD  
covers, clothing, billboards, television shows, magazines, newspapers, photographs, and  
websites.

5 These texts abound in our electronic information age, and the messages they

convey, both overt and implied, can have a significant influence on students lives. For  
this reason, critical thinking as it applies to media products and messages assumes a   
special significance. Understanding how media texts are constructed and why they are  
produced enables students to respond to them intelligently and responsibly. Students  
must be able to differentiate between fact and opinion; evaluate the credibility of sources;  
recognize bias; be attuned to discriminatory portrayals of individuals and groups, such as  
religious or sexual minorities, people with disabilities, or seniors; and question depictions  
of violence and crime.

Students repertoire of communication skills should include the ability to critically inter-  
pret the messages they receive through the various media and to use these media to com-  
municate their own ideas effectively as well. Skills related to high-tech media such as the  
Internet, film, and television are particularly important because of the power and perva-  
sive influence these media wield in our lives and in society. Becoming conversant with  
these and other media can greatly expand the range of information sources available to  
students, and enhance potential career opportunities in the communication and entertain-  
ment industries.

To develop their media literacy skills, students should have opportunities to view,  
analyse, and discuss a wide variety of media texts and relate them to their own experi-  
ence. They should also have opportunities to use available technologies to create media  
texts of different types (e.g., computer graphics, cartoons, graphic designs and layouts,  
radio plays, short videos, web pages).

5. Teachers should make students aware that images, print materials, music, or video clips used in connection with  
tasks and assignments may be subject to copyright, and the appropriate releases should be obtained prior to use. This  
applies to items downloaded from the Internet as well.



  

This strand focuses on helping students develop the skills required to understand, create,  
and critically interpret media texts. It examines how images (both moving and still),  
sound, and words are used, independently and in combination, to create meaning. It  
explores the use and significance of particular conventions and techniques in the media  
and considers the roles of the viewer and the producer in constructing meaning in media  
texts. Students apply the knowledge and skills gained through analysis of media texts as  
they create their own texts.

In the specific expectations in this strand, the examples and teacher prompts refer to  
media forms and conventions that are appropriate for instruction in the given course.  
These are not, however, the only forms and conventions that students may explore in the  
course, nor are they exclusive to the course. Teachers will continue to use their profes-  
sional judgement to decide on the forms and conventions students will study in every  
course, based on the identified learning needs of the students in their classrooms.

*Optional Courses
----------------*The expectations in the optional courses in the English program are clustered in strands  
suited to the particular theme or focus of the course. 

The Grade 10 optional course, Literacy Skills: Reading and Writing, contains two strands:  
Reading Skills and Writing Skills.

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information  
gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses  
in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also  
serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students   
needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices.

Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources (including  
assignments, demonstrations, projects, performances, and tests) that accurately reflects  
how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a course. As part of  
assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts  
towards improvement. Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student  
work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.

Assessment and evaluation will be based on the provincial curriculum expectations and  
the achievement levels outlined in this document.

In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they  
lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evalua-  
tion strategies that:

address both what students learn and how well they learn;

are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement  
level descriptions given in the achievement chart on pages 24 25; 

are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide  
opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning; 

are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the  
needs and experiences of the students;

AND EVALUATION

are fair to all students; 

accommodate the needs of students with special education needs, consistent with  
the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan; 

accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction  
(English or French);

ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement; 

promote students ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals; 

include the use of samples of students work that provide evidence of   
their achievement; 

are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the course or  
the school term and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses  
on students achievement of the overall expectations. A student s achievement of the  
overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific  
expectations. The overall expectations are broad in nature, and the specific expectations  
define the particular content or scope of the knowledge and skills referred to in the over-  
all expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which spe-  
cific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of the overall expectations, and  
which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment (e.g., through direct observa-  
tion) but not necessarily evaluated.

The characteristics given in the achievement chart (pages 24 25) for level 3 represent the  
 provincial standard for achievement of the expectations in a course. A complete picture  
of overall achievement at level 3 in a course in English can be constructed by reading  
from top to bottom in the shaded column of the achievement chart, headed 70 79%  
(Level 3) . Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will  
be prepared for work in subsequent courses.

Level 1 identifies achievement that falls much below the provincial standard, while still  
reflecting a passing grade. Level 2 identifies achievement that approaches the standard.  
Level 4 identifies achievement that surpasses the standard. It should be noted that  
achievement at level 4 does not mean that the student has achieved expectations beyond  
those specified for a particular course. It indicates that the student has achieved all or  
almost all of the expectations for that course, and that he or she demonstrates the ability  
to use the specified knowledge and skills in more sophisticated ways than a student  
achieving at level 3.

THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART FOR ENGLISH
---------------------------------

The achievement chart that follows identifies four categories of knowledge and skills in  
English. The achievement chart is a standard province-wide guide to be used by teachers.  
It enables teachers to make judgements about student work that are based on clear per-  
formance standards and on a body of evidence collected over time.

The purpose of the achievement chart is to:

provide a common framework that encompasses all curriculum expectations for   
all courses outlined in this document; 

guide the development of quality assessment tasks and tools (including rubrics); 

help teachers to plan instruction for learning; 

assist teachers in providing meaningful feedback to students;

provide various categories and criteria with which to assess and evaluate   
students learning.

Categories of Knowledge and Skills
----------------------------------

The categories, defined by clear criteria, represent four broad areas of knowledge and  
skills within which the subject expectations for any given course are organized. The four  
categories should be considered as interrelated, reflecting the wholeness and intercon-  
nectedness of learning.

The categories of knowledge and skills are described as follows:

*Knowledge and Understanding.
----------------------------*

Subject-specific content acquired in each course (knowl-

edge), and the comprehension of its meaning and significance (understanding).

*Thinking.
---------*

The use of critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes, as follows:

planning skills (e.g., generating ideas, gathering information, focusing research,  
organizing information)

processing skills (e.g., drawing inferences, interpreting, analysing, synthesizing,  
evaluating)

critical/creative thinking processes (e.g., oral discourse, research, critical analysis,  
critical literacy, metacognition, creative process)

*Communication.
--------------*

The conveying of meaning through various text forms.

*Application.
------------*

The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between

various contexts.

Teachers will ensure that student work is assessed and/or evaluated in a balanced man-  
ner with respect to the four categories, and that achievement of particular expectations is  
considered within the appropriate categories.

Criteria
--------

Within each category in the achievement chart, criteria are provided that are subsets of  
the knowledge and skills that define each category. For example, in Knowledge and  
Understanding, the criteria are knowledge of content (e.g., forms of text; strategies used  
when listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing; elements of  
style; literary terminology, concepts, and theories; language conventions) and under-  
standing of content (e.g., concepts; ideas; opinions; relationships among facts, ideas, con-  
cepts, themes) . The criteria identify the aspects of student performance that are assessed  
and/or evaluated, and serve as guides to what to look for.

Descriptors
-----------

A descriptor indicates the characteristic of the student s performance, with respect to   
a particular criterion, on which assessment or evaluation is focused. In the achievement  
chart, *effectiveness
-------------*is the descriptor used for each criterion in the Thinking, Communication,  
and Application categories. What constitutes effectiveness in any given performance task  
will vary with the particular criterion being considered. Assessment of effectiveness may  
therefore focus on a quality such as appropriateness, clarity, accuracy, precision, logic,  
relevance, significance, fluency, flexibility, depth, or breadth, as appropriate for the particu-  
lar criterion. For example, in the Thinking category, assessment of effectiveness might  
focus on the degree of relevance or depth apparent in an analysis; in the Communication  
category, on clarity of expression or logical organization of information and ideas; or in  
the Application category, on appropriateness or breadth in the making of connections.  
Similarly, in the Knowledge and Understanding category, assessment of knowledge might  
focus on accuracy, and assessment of understanding might focus on the depth of an  
explanation. Descriptors help teachers to focus their assessment and evaluation on specific  
knowledge and skills for each category and criterion, and help students to better under-  
stand exactly what is being assessed and evaluated.

Qualifiers
----------

A specific qualifier is used to define each of the four levels of achievement that is,  
*limited
-------*for level 1, *some
----*for level 2, *considerable
------------*for level 3, and a *high degree
-----------*or *thorough
--------*for  
level 4. A qualifier is used along with a descriptor to produce a description of perform-  
ance at a particular level. For example, the description of a student s performance at   
level 3 with respect to the first criterion in the Thinking category would be: the student  
uses planning skills with *considerable
------------*effectiveness . 

The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in the chart should be used to identify  
the level at which the student has achieved the expectations. In all of their courses, stu-  
dents should be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate the full extent  
of their achievement of the curriculum expectations across all four categories of knowl-  
edge and skills.

EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Student achievement must be communicated formally to students and parents by means  
of the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12. The report card provides a record of the stu-  
dent s achievement of the curriculum expectations in every course, at particular points in  
the school year or semester, in the form of a percentage grade. The percentage grade rep-  
resents the quality of the student s overall achievement of the expectations for the course  
and reflects the corresponding level of achievement as described in the achievement chart  
for the discipline.

A final grade is recorded for every course, and a credit is granted and recorded for every  
course in which the student s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for each course in  
Grades 9 to 12 will be determined as follows:

Seventy per cent of the grade will be based on evaluations conducted throughout  
the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student s most consistent  
level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should  
be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

Thirty per cent of the grade will be based on a final evaluation in the form of an  
examination, performance, essay, and/or other method of evaluation suitable to   
the course content and administered towards the end of the course.

REPORTING ON DEMONSTRATED LEARNING SKILLS
-----------------------------------------

The report card provides a record of the learning skills demonstrated by the student in  
every course, in the following five categories: Works Independently, Teamwork, Organization,  
Work Habits, and Initiative. The learning skills are evaluated using a four-point scale   
(E-Excellent, G-Good, S-Satisfactory, N-Needs Improvement). The separate evaluation  
and reporting of the learning skills in these five areas reflect their critical role in students   
achievement of the curriculum expectations. To the extent possible, the evaluation of  
learning skills, apart from any that may be included as part of a curriculum expectation  
in a course, should not be considered in the determination of percentage grades.

MINISTRY RESOURCES
------------------

The Ministry of Education has produced or supported the production of a variety of  
resource documents that teachers may find helpful as they plan programs based on the  
expectations outlined in this curriculum document. Those resources include the following:

www.edu.gov.on.ca.

INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
------------------------

The English curriculum is based on the premise that *all students can be successful languagelearners
-----------------------------------------------*. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality  
instruction. 

Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students strengths and address their  
learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose  
for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for   
individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and  
model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and  
learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practise and  
apply their developing knowledge and skills.

SOME

CONSIDERATIONS FOR

PROGRAM PLANNING 



  

Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills  
and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fair-  
ness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

Motivating students and instilling positive habits of mind, such as a willingness and  
determination to persist, to think and communicate with clarity and precision, to take  
responsible risks, and to question and pose problems, are also integral to high-quality  
language instruction.

Language is best learned through activities that present stimulating ideas, issues, and  
themes that are meaningful to students. Since no single instructional approach can meet  
all the needs of each learner, teachers select classroom activities that are based on an  
assessment of students individual needs, proven learning theory, and best practices. In  
effective English programs, teachers introduce a rich variety of activities that integrate  
expectations from different strands and provide for the explicit teaching of knowledge  
and skills. They also provide frequent opportunities for students to rehearse, practise, and  
apply skills and strategies, and to make their own choices. 

PLANNING ENGLISH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs.  
They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with  
special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. *Special EducationTransformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table onSpecial Education, 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for  
students with special education needs *in all disciplines
------------------*. Those beliefs are as follows:

All students can succeed. 

Universal design and differentiated instruction are effective and interconnected  
means of meeting the learning or productivity needs of any group of students.

Successful instructional practices are founded on evidence-based research,   
tempered by experience.

Classroom teachers are key educators for a student s literacy and numeracy   
development.

Each student has his or her own unique patterns of learning.

Classroom teachers need the support of the larger community to create a learning  
environment that supports students with special education needs.

Fairness is not sameness. 

In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and  
needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance  
tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest pos-  
sible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for  
instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs  
that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.

In planning English courses for students with special education needs, teachers should  
begin by examining the current achievement level of the individual student, the strengths

and learning needs of the student, and the knowledge and skills that all students are  
expected to demonstrate at the end of the course, in order to determine which of the fol-  
lowing options is appropriate for the student: 

no accommodations

6 or modifications; or 

accommodations only; or 

modified expectations, with the possibility of accommodations; or

alternative expectations, which are not derived from the curriculum expectations  
for a course and which constitute alternative programs and/or courses.

If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the rele-  
vant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or  
her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs  
for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative  
programs and/or courses, can be found in *The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A ResourceGuide, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*). For a detailed discussion  
of the ministry s requirements for IEPs, see *Individual Education Plans: Standards forDevelopment, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*(referred to hereafter as *IEPStandards, 2000
------------------*). (Both documents are available at www.edu.gov.on.ca.) 

Students Requiring Accommodations Only
--------------------------------------

Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course  
curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to  
the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student s learning must be  
identified in his or her IEP (see *IEP Standards, 2000
-------------------*, page 11). A student s IEP is likely to  
reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. 

Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first  
option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design  
and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the  
diverse needs of learners.

There are three types of accommodations:

*Instructional accommodations
----------------------------*are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of  
presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. 

*Environmental accommodations
----------------------------*are changes that the student may require in the class-  
room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. 

*Assessment accommodations
-------------------------*are changes in assessment procedures that enable the  
student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to  
complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see  
page 29 of the *IEP Resource Guide, 2004
------------------------*, for more examples). 

If a student requires accommodations only in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expecta-  
tions and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student s  
Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of  
accommodations will be included.

6. Accommodations refers to individualized teaching and assessment strategies, human supports, and/or   
individualized equipment.



  

Students Requiring Modified Expectations
----------------------------------------

Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course  
expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular  
course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations.  
Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achieve-  
ments and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate  
independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.

It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student s IEP, the extent to which  
expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry s policy docu-  
ment *Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*, the  
principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes  
successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to  
receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and  
the student. 

When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course,  
the modified expectations should identify *how the required knowledge and skills differ fromthose identified in the course expectations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*. When modifications are so extensive that achieve-  
ment of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely  
to result in a credit, the expectations should *specify the precise requirements or tasks on whichthe student s performance will be evaluated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*and which will be used to generate the course  
mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. 

Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to  
demonstrate and have assessed *in each reporting period
------------------------*(*IEP Standards, 2000,
--------------------*pages 10 and 11).  
The student s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student s progress  
at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (*IEP Standards,2000
------------------*, page 11). 

If a student requires modified expectations in English courses, assessment and evaluation  
of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP  
and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student s learn-  
ing expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for  
the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card. If,  
however, the student s learning expectations are modified to such an extent that the prin-  
cipal deems that a credit will not be granted for the course, the IEP box must be checked  
and the appropriate statement from the *Guide to the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9 12,1999
-----------------------------------------------------*(page 8) must be inserted. The teacher s comments should include relevant informa-  
tion on the student s demonstrated learning of the modified expectations, as well as next  
steps for the student s learning in the course. 

PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
----------------------------------------------------

Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The  
first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario s English language  
schools is a language other than English. Ontario s linguistic heritage includes several  
Aboriginal languages; many African, Asian, and European languages; and some varieties  
of English, such as Jamaican Creole. Many English language learners were born in  
Canada and raised in families and communities in which languages other than English

were spoken, or in which the variety of English spoken differed significantly from the  
English of Ontario classrooms. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as new-  
comers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educa-  
tional systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling  
was limited.

When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic  
and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for their English lan-  
guage development.

English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional  
language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge  
and experience to the classroom. These students linguistic and cultural backgrounds not  
only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in  
the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity  
into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment.

Most English language learners in Ontario schools have an age-appropriate proficiency in  
their first language. Although they need frequent opportunities to use English at school,  
there are important educational and social benefits associated with continued develop-  
ment of their first language while they are learning English. Teachers need to encourage  
parents to continue to use their own language at home in rich and varied ways as a foun-  
dation for language and literacy development in English. It is also important for teachers  
to find opportunities to bring students languages into the classroom, using parents and  
community members as a resource.

During their first few years in Ontario schools, English language learners may receive  
support through one of two distinct programs from teachers who specialize in meeting  
their language-learning needs:

*English as a Second Language (ESL)
----------------------------------*

programs are for students born in Canada or new-

comers whose first language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English  
significantly different from that used for instruction in Ontario schools. 

*English Literacy Development (ELD)
----------------------------------*

programs are primarily for newcomers whose first

language is a language other than English, or is a variety of English significantly different  
from that used for instruction in Ontario schools, and who arrive with significant gaps in  
their education. These students generally come from countries where access to education  
is limited or where there are limited opportunities to develop language and literacy skills  
in any language. Some Aboriginal students from remote communities in Ontario may  
also have had limited opportunities for formal schooling, and they also may benefit from  
ELD instruction.

In planning programs for students with linguistic backgrounds other than English, teach-  
ers need to recognize the importance of the orientation process, understanding that every  
learner needs to adjust to the new social environment and language in a unique way and  
at an individual pace. For example, students who are in an early stage of English-language  
acquisition may go through a silent period during which they closely observe the inter-  
actions and physical surroundings of their new learning environment. They may use  
body language rather than speech or they may use their first language until they have

gained enough proficiency in English to feel confident of their interpretations and  
responses. Students thrive in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment that nur-  
tures their self-confidence while they are receiving focused literacy instruction. When  
they are ready to participate, in paired, small-group, or whole-class activities, some   
students will begin by using a single word or phrase to communicate a thought, while  
others will speak quite fluently.

With exposure to the English language in a supportive learning environment, most young  
children will develop oral fluency quite quickly, making connections between concepts  
and skills acquired in their first language and similar concepts and skills presented in  
English. However, oral fluency is not a good indicator of a student s knowledge of vocab-  
ulary or sentence structure, reading comprehension, or other aspects of language profi-  
ciency that play an important role in literacy development and academic success.  
Research has shown that it takes five to seven years for most English language learners to  
catch up to their English-speaking peers in their ability to use English for academic pur-  
poses. Moreover, the older the children are when they arrive, the greater the language  
knowledge and skills that they have to catch up on, and the more direct support they  
require from their teachers.

Responsibility for students English-language development is shared by the classroom  
teacher, the ESL/ELD teacher (where available), and other school staff. Volunteers and  
peers may also be helpful in supporting English language learners in the language class-  
room. Teachers must adapt the instructional program in order to facilitate the success of  
these students in their classrooms. Appropriate adaptations include:

modification of some or all of the subject expectations so that they are challenging  
but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given  
the necessary support from the teacher; 

use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, graphic  
organizers, scaffolding; previewing of textbooks, pre-teaching of key vocabulary;  
peer tutoring; strategic use of students first languages); 

use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual   
dictionaries, and materials that reflect cultural diversity); 

use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; use of oral inter-  
views, demonstrations or visual representations, or tasks requiring completion of  
graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of essay questions and other assess-  
ment tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).

When learning expectations in any course are modified for an English language learner  
(whether the student is enrolled in an ESL or ELD course or not), this information must  
be clearly indicated on the student s report card.

Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students  
who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adapta-  
tions to be successful.

ANTIDISCRIMINATION EDUCATION Overview
-------------------------------------

The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects   
of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to high  
standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of  
identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value  
and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to  
adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence,  
and expressions of hate. 

Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves  
and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships,  
and active, responsible citizenship. 

Schools also have the opportunity to ensure that school-community interaction reflects the  
diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a  
variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members  
from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays,  
concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with  
the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach  
and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. 

Antidiscrimination Education in the English Program
---------------------------------------------------

Learning resources that reflect the broad range of students interests, backgrounds, cultures,  
and experiences are an important aspect of an inclusive English program. In such a program,  
learning materials involve protagonists of both sexes from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Teachers routinely use materials that reflect the diversity of Canadian and world cultures,  
including those of contemporary First Nations, M tis, and Inuit peoples, and make them  
available to students. Short stories, novels, magazine and newspaper articles, television  
programs, and films provide opportunities for students to explore issues relating to their  
self-identity. In inclusive programs, students are made aware of the historical, cultural,  
and political contexts for both the traditional and non-traditional gender and social roles  
represented in the materials they are studying. 

Stories, novels, informational texts, and media works relating to the immigrant experience  
provide rich thematic material for study, as well as the opportunity for students new to  
Canada to share their knowledge and experiences with others. In addition, in the context  
of the English program, both students and teachers should become aware of aspects of  
intercultural communication for example, by exploring how different cultures interpret  
the use of eye contact and body language in conversation and during presentations.

Resources should be chosen not only to reflect diversity but also on the basis of their  
appeal for both girls and boys in the classroom. Recent research has shown that many  
boys are interested in informational materials, such as manuals and graphic texts, as  
opposed to works of fiction, which are often more appealing to girls. Both sexes read  
Internet materials, such as website articles, e-mail, and chat messages, outside the class-  
room. *Me Read? No Way! A Practical Guide to Improving Boys Literacy Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------*(available on the  
Ministry of Education website) provides a number of useful literacy strategies that focus  
on engaging boys in reading and writing and that can enhance the learning environment  
for both female and male students.

The development of critical thinking skills is integral to the English curriculum. In the  
context of what is now called critical literacy , these skills include the ability to identify  
perspectives, values, and issues; detect bias; and read for implicit as well as overt mean-  
ing. In the English program, students develop the ability to detect negative bias and  
stereotypes in literary texts and informational materials. When using biased informa-  
tional texts, or literary works containing negative stereotypes, for the express purpose of  
critical analysis, teachers must take into account the potential negative impact of bias on  
students and use appropriate strategies to address students responses.

Critical literacy also involves asking questions and challenging the status quo, and leads  
students to look at issues of power and justice in society. The program empowers stu-  
dents by enabling them to express themselves and to speak out about issues that strongly  
affect them.

Literature studies and media studies also afford both students and teachers a unique  
opportunity to explore the social and emotional impact of bullying, violence, and discrim-  
ination in the form of racism, sexism, or homophobia on individuals and families.  
Teachers can help students link the understanding they gain in this regard to messages  
conveyed through the school s antibullying and violence-prevention programming.

LITERACY, MATHEMATICAL LITERACY, AND INQUIRY/RESEARCH SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy, mathematical literacy, and inquiry/research skills are critical to students success  
in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. 

The acquisition and development of literacy skills is clearly the focus of the English cur-  
riculum, but the English program also builds on, reinforces, and enhances mathematical  
literacy. For example, clear, concise communication often involves the use of diagrams,  
charts, tables, and graphs, and the English curriculum emphasizes students ability to  
interpret and use graphic texts. 

Inquiry is at the heart of learning in all subject areas. In English courses, students are  
encouraged to develop their ability to ask questions and to explore a variety of possible  
answers to those questions. As they advance through the grades, they acquire the skills to  
locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, diction-  
aries, encyclopaedias, interviews, videos, and the Internet. The questioning they practised  
in the early grades becomes more sophisticated as they learn that all sources of informa-  
tion have a particular point of view and that the recipient of the information has a  
responsibility to evaluate it, determine its validity and relevance, and use it in appropri-  
ate ways. The ability to locate, question, and validate information allows a student to  
become an independent, lifelong learner.

THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------

The school library program can help to build and transform students knowledge to support  
lifelong learning in our information- and knowledge-based society. The school library  
program supports student success across the language curriculum by encouraging students  
to read widely, teaching them to read for understanding and enjoyment, and helping them  
to improve their research skills and to use information gathered through research effectively. 

THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM,GRADES 9 AND 10
--------------------------------------

The school library program enables students to:

develop a love of reading for learning and for pleasure; 

acquire an understanding of the richness and diversity of literary and informational   
texts produced in Canada and around the world; 

obtain access to programs, resources, and integrated technologies that support   
all curriculum areas; 

understand and value the role of public library systems as a resource for   
lifelong learning.

The school library program plays a key role in the development of information literacy  
and research skills. In collaboration with classroom or content-area teachers, teacher-  
librarians develop, teach, and provide students with authentic information and research  
tasks that foster learning, including the ability to:

locate, select, gather, critically evaluate, create, and communicate information;

use the information obtained to solve problems, make decisions, build knowledge,   
create personal meaning, and enrich their lives; 

communicate their findings for different audiences, using a variety of formats   
and technologies; 

use information and research with understanding, responsibility, and imagination.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------

Information and communications technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can   
significantly extend and enrich teachers instructional strategies and support students   
language learning. ICT tools include multimedia resources, databases, Internet websites,  
digital cameras, and word-processing programs. Tools such as these can help students to  
collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present reports on  
their findings. Information and communications technologies can also be used to connect  
students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into  
the local classroom.

Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support  
and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in  
groups can use computer technology and/or Internet websites to gain access to museums  
and archives in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital cameras and  
projectors to design and present the results of their research to their classmates.

Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its  
use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible  
use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to  
promote hatred.

Teachers will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole-  
class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to  
learning to meet diverse student needs.

THE ONTARIO SKILLS PASSPORT AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS
------------------------------------------------

Teachers planning programs in English need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of  
the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that  
enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school work  
connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text,  
Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and  
includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how  
workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are  
used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work  
habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service.  
The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students demonstration of  
these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can  
use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill  
development, and show employers what they can do. 

The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada  
and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through  
extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills  
provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their  
jobs and adapt to workplace change. For further information on the OSP and the  
Essential Skills, visit http://skills.edu.gov.on.ca.

CAREER EDUCATION
----------------

Expectations in the English program include many opportunities for students to apply  
their language skills to work-related situations, to explore educational and career options,  
and to become self-directed learners. To prepare students for the literacy demands of a  
wide array of postsecondary educational programs and careers, English courses require  
students to develop research skills, practise expository writing, and learn strategies for  
understanding informational reading materials. Making oral presentations and working  
in small groups with classmates help students express themselves confidently and work  
cooperatively with others. Regardless of their postsecondary destination, all students need  
to realize that literacy skills are employability skills. Powerful literacy skills will equip  
students to manage information technologies, communicate effectively and correctly in a  
variety of situations, and perform a variety of tasks required in most work environments.

COOPERATIVE EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing,  
field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed  
in the classroom to real-life activities in the community and in the world of business and  
public service. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to  
broaden students knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields,  
including publishing, advertising, and media-related industries. In addition, students  
develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of  
employer employee relationships. Teachers of English can support their students learning  
by maintaining links with community-based businesses to ensure that students have access  
to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills gained in school.

Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education  
and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace  
learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand  
the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part  
in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed  
for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality  
as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the  
right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be  
aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal  
safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies  
and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.

Policy/Program Memorandum No. 76A, Workplace Safety and Insurance Coverage for  
Students in Work Education Programs (September 2000), outlines procedures for ensuring  
the provision of Health and Safety Insurance Board coverage for students who are at least  
14 years of age and are on placements of more than one day. (A one-day job-shadowing  
or job-twinning experience is treated as a field trip.) Teachers should also be aware of the  
minimum age requirements outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act for persons  
to be in or to be working in specific workplace settings. All cooperative education and  
other workplace experiences will be provided in accordance with the ministry s policy  
document entitled *Cooperative Education and Other Forms of Experiential Learning: Policiesand Procedures for Ontario Secondary Schools, 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

PLANNING PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS LEADING TO A SPECIALIST HIGH-SKILLS MAJOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

English courses are well suited for inclusion in programs leading to a Specialist High-  
Skills Major (SHSM) or in programs designed to provide pathways to particular appren-  
ticeship or workplace destinations. In an SHSM program, English courses can be bundled  
with other courses to provide the academic knowledge and skills important to particular  
industry sectors and required for success in the workplace and postsecondary education,  
including apprenticeship. English courses may also be combined with cooperative educa-  
tion credits to provide the workplace experience required for SHSM programs and for  
various program pathways to apprenticeship and workplace destinations. (SHSM pro-  
grams would also include sector-specific learning opportunities offered by employers,  
skills-training centres, colleges, and community organizations.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE ENGLISH PROGRAM
----------------------------------------

Although health and safety issues are not usually associated with language education, they  
may be important when the learning involves fieldwork. Out-of-school fieldwork can  
provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students learning experiences. Teachers  
must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students health and safety.
